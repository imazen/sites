**Efficient and subjective guide to images in 2023**

For an in-depth understanding, check out the sidebar. This is a quick reference for upgrading those `<img>` tags to handle various sizes and pixel densities of modern devices. You should [know that pixels aren't pixels](/en/pixels-not-pixels), and that `devicePixelRatio` is more likely to be 3.875 than 1:1. Modern phones pretend to be between 320-428px wide (in CSS pixels) for legibility, but many device pixels support each CSS pixel.

> If your image will never change size no matter how narrow the browser window is, use [density descriptors](/en/density-descriptors) instead. This usually applies to logos, icons, and buttons.

Do you know your [breakpoints](/en/breakpoints)? You need these numbers to fine-tune the solutions below - at minimum the viewport width breakpoint where the main content area stops growing.


### Simple

```html

<img src="img.jpg?w=480" 
     srcset="img.jpg?format=webp&w=480 480w, 
             img.jpg?format=webp&w=800 800w, 
             img.jpg?format=webp&w=1200 1200w, 
             img.jpg?format=webp&w=1600 1600w, 
             img.jpg?format=webp&w=2000 2000w"
     sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 800px" 
     alt="dog riding bike" />

<!-- We assume your breakpoint is at 700px. At that viewport width, this image takes up 100% of the width,
     but when the viewport is larger, the image is capped at 800 CSS pixels -->

<!-- This assumes you're using an RIAPI-compatible image server such as Imageflow. On-the-fly image variant generation is vital for developers' sanity. -->
```
