**An Efficient and Opinionated Guide to Images in 2023**

Check the sidebar for an in-depth discussion. This is a quick reference to upgrade those `<img>` tags to adapt to the various sizes and pixel densities of modern devices. You should [understand that pixels != pixels](/zh/pixels-not-pixels), and that `devicePixelRatio` is more likely to be closer to 3.875 rather than 1:1. Modern phones pretend to be 320-428px wide for readability (in CSS pixels), but each CSS pixel comprises multiple device pixels.

> If your image size never changes, no matter how narrow you make the browser window, you should use [density descriptors](/zh/density-descriptors) instead. This usually applies to logos, icons, and buttons.

Do you know what your [breakpoints](/zh/breakpoints) are? You'll need these numbers to fine-tune the solution below—at least the viewport width breakpoint at which the main content area stops growing.

### Simple Method

```html

<img src="img.jpg?w=480" 
        srcset="img.jpg?format=webp&w=480 480w, 
                img.jpg?format=webp&w=800 800w, 
                img.jpg?format=webp&w=1200 1200w, 
                img.jpg?format=webp&w=1600 1600w, 
                img.jpg?format=webp&w=2000 2000w"

        sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 800px" alt="Dog riding a bicycle" />

<!-- We assume you have a breakpoint at 700px.
      Below this viewport width, the image takes up 100% of the width, but when the viewport is larger, the image is limited to 800 CSS pixels -->

<!-- Assuming you are using a RIAPI-compliant image server such as Imageflow.
     On-the-fly generation of image variants is crucial for a developer’s sanity. -->
```

{{Note: The phrase "having a breakpoint" might sound a bit informal; a more technical term could be "configured a breakpoint" or "established a breakpoint."}}
