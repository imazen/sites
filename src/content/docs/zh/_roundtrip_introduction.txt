**Efficient and Insightful Guide to Responsive Images in 2023**

Please see the sidebar for a deeper dive. This is a quick reference intended to upgrade the `<img>` tag to handle various sizes and pixel densities on modern devices. You should [know that a pixel ≠ a pixel](/en-us/pixels-not-pixels), and that the `devicePixelRatio` is more likely to be closer to 3.875 than 1:1. Modern phones pretend to have widths of 320-428px for readability. 

> If your images will never change size no matter how narrow you shrink the browser window, you should use [density descriptors](/en-us/density-descriptors). This typically applies to logos, icons, and buttons.

Do you know what your [breakpoints](/en-us/breakpoints) are? You'll need those numbers to fine-tune the solutions below – and at minimum, you need a viewport-width breakpoint, where your main content area stops growing.

### Simple technique

```html
<img src="img.jpg?w=480" 
     srcset="img.jpg?format=webp&amp;w=480 480w, 
             img.jpg?format=webp&amp;w=800 800w, 
             img.jpg?format=webp&amp;w=1200 1200w, 
             img.jpg?format=webp&amp;w=1600 1600w, 
             img.jpg?format=webp&amp;w=2000 2000w"
     sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 800px" alt="Dog riding bicycle" />

<!-- We're assuming you have a breakpoint at 700px. 
     If the viewport width is smaller than that width, the image will take up the entire width; when the viewport is wider, the image will be constrained to 800 CSS pixels wide. -->

<!-- This also assumes that you're using an image server that complies with the RIAPI standard, such as Imageflow. 
      Generating variant images in real-time is crucial for developers' normal workflow. -->
```
