**An Efficient and Opinionated Guide to Images in 2023**

Please check the sidebar for a deep dive. This is a quick reference for upgrading your `<img>` tags to handle modern devices in their various sizes and pixel densities. You should [know that a pixel != a pixel](/en/pixels-not-pixels), and that `devicePixelRatio`s are more likely to be 3.875 than 1:1. Modern phones pretend to be 320-428px wide (in CSS pixels) for legibility, but each CSS pixel is made up of many device pixels.

> If your image dimensions will never change, no matter how narrow you shrink the browser window, you should use [density descriptors](/en/density-descriptors). This is typically true for logos, icons, and buttons.

Do you know your [breakpoints](/en/breakpoints)? You'll need those numbers to adjust the schemes below--at the very least the viewport width breakpoint where your main content area stops growing.

### A Simple Approach

```html
<img src="img.jpg?w=480" 
     srcset="img.jpg?format=webp&w=480 480w, 
             img.jpg?format=webp&w=800 800w, 
             img.jpg?format=webp&w=1200 1200w, 
             img.jpg?format=webp&w=1600 1600w, 
             img.jpg?format=webp&w=2000 2000w"
     sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 800px" alt="Dog on a bicycle">

<!-- We're assuming you have a breakpoint at 700 pixels, and that 
     at that viewport width, this image takes up 100% of the width, but 
     it's capped at 800 CSS pixels when the viewport is larger. -->

<!-- This assumes that you're using an image server that conforms to the RIAPI standard, such as Imageflow. Making variants of images on the fly is essential for developer sanity. -->
