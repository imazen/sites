**A Practical and Insightful Guide to Responsive Images in 2023**

For an in-depth look, please see the sidebar. This is a quick reference for upgrading `<img>` tags to handle images on modern devices with various sizes and pixel densities. You should [know that a pixel is not a pixel](/en/pixels-not-pixels) and that `devicePixelRatio` is most likely 3.875, not 1:1. Modern phones pretend to have a width of 320-428 pixels for the sake of readability.

> If your images will never change size, no matter how narrow the browser window, you should use [density descriptors](/en/density-descriptors). This usually applies to logos, icons, and buttons.

Do you know your [breakpoints](/en/breakpoints)? You'll need those numbers to fine-tune the solutions belowâ€”at least the viewport width where the main content area stops growing.


### A Simple Solution

```html

<img src="img.jpg?w=480"
        srcset="img.jpg?format=webp&w=480 480w, 
                img.jpg?format=webp&w=800 800w, 
                img.jpg?format=webp&w=1200 1200w, 
                img.jpg?format=webp&w=1600 1600w, 
                img.jpg?format=webp&w=2000 2000w"

        sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 800px" alt="Dog Riding a Bicycle" />

<!-- We assume you have a breakpoint at 700px. And at that viewport width, this image takes up 100% of the width, but is limited to 800 CSS pixels when the viewport is larger. -->

<!-- This also assumes you're using an image server that's compatible with the RIA API, such as Imageflow. Instantly generating image variants is crucial for a developer's well-being. -->
