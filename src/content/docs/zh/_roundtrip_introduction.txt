**Efficient and insightful guide to responsive images in 2023**

Please check the sidebar for more in-depth information. This is a quick reference for upgrading your `<img>` tags to handle various sizes and pixel densities on modern devices. You should [know that a pixel is not a pixel](/en/pixels-not-pixels) and that `devicePixelRatio` is more likely to be 3.875 than 1:1. Modern phones pretend to be 320-428 pixels wide (in CSS pixels) for readability, but each CSS pixel has many device pixels.

>If your images will never change size regardless of how narrow the browser window gets, you should use [density descriptors](/en/density-descriptors). This is typically for logos, icons, and buttons.

Do you know what your [breakpoints](/en/breakpoints) are? You need these numbers to fine-tune the solutions below, at minimum a viewport width breakpoint where the main content area stops growing.

### Simple Solution

```html
<img src="img.jpg?w=480" 
     srcset="img.jpg?format=webp&amp;w=480 480w, 
             img.jpg?format=webp&amp;w=800 800w, 
             img.jpg?format=webp&amp;w=1200 1200w, 
             img.jpg?format=webp&amp;w=1600 1600w, 
             img.jpg?format=webp&amp;w=2000 2000w"
     sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 800px" alt="Dog riding a bicycle" />

<!-- We're assuming you have a breakpoint at 700px. 
 When the viewport is below this width, the image takes up 100% of the width, but 
 it's restricted to 800 CSS pixels once the viewport gets larger. -->

<!-- This assumes you're using an image server that conforms to the RIAPI standard, e.g. Imageflow. 
 Dynamically generating image URLs is essential for developer sanity. -->
```

{{Note that the "&" character in the code block should be "&amp;" for valid html.}}
