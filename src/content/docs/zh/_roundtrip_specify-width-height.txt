Why Should You Set Width and Height in HTML?

> It is recommended to specify the width and height attributes for images in HTML code because it helps web browsers understand the size of the image before it is fully loaded. This enables the browser to reserve adequate space for the image on the webpage, preventing content from jumping around as the image loads.
>
> Additionally, specifying the width and height attributes for images can also help improve the overall performance of the webpage. When the browser knows the size of the image beforehand, it can accurately calculate the amount of space needed to display the image and avoid unnecessary reflows or repaints during the loading process.
>
> Overall, using the width and height attributes in HTML code can enhance the user experience by improving content loading speed and reducing visual glitches.
