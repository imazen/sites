Why Set Width and Height in HTML?

> It is recommended to set width and height attributes for images in HTML code because it helps web browsers know the dimensions of the images before they are fully loaded. This allows the browser to reserve appropriate space on the webpage for the images, preventing content from shifting during image loading.
>
> Additionally, specifying width and height attributes for images helps improve overall webpage performance. When the browser knows the image dimensions in advance, it can more accurately calculate the space needed to display the images, avoiding unnecessary reflows or repaints during loading.
>
> Overall, using width and height attributes in HTML code can enhance user experience by speeding up content loading and reducing visual glitches.
