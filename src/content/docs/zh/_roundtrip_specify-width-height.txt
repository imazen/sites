## Using Width and Height in HTML

Why should you include width and height attributes in your HTML?

It is recommended to add width and height attributes to images in your HTML code because it helps web browsers know the size of the image before it is fully loaded. This enables the browser to properly reserve space for the image on the webpage and prevent content from jumping around while the image is loading.

Additionally, specifying the width and height of an image can also improve the overall performance of a webpage. When the browser knows the size of the image in advance, it can more accurately calculate the space required to display the image and avoid unnecessary reflow or repaint during the loading process.

Overall, using width and height attributes on images in your HTML code can improve the user experience by making content load faster and reducing visual glitches.
