Why should you set width and height in HTML?

> It is recommended to set the width and height attributes of images in HTML code because it allows web browsers to know the size of the image before it is fully loaded. This allows the browser to reserve the appropriate space for the image on the webpage, thereby preventing content from jumping around while the image loads.
>
> Additionally, specifying the width and height attributes of an image can help improve the overall performance of a webpage. When the browser knows the size of the image beforehand, it can more accurately calculate the space needed to display the image and avoid unnecessary reflow or repaint.
>
> Overall, using width and height attributes for images in HTML code can enhance the user experience, make content load faster, and reduce visual disruptions.
