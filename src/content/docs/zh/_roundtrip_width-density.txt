Learn about width (`w`) and pixel density (`x`) descriptors in `srcset`. Use examples and Markdown.

>`srcset` is an HTML attribute that allows developers to provide multiple image sources with different resolutions or pixel densities, and let the browser select the appropriate image based on the display characteristics of the device. The `srcset` attribute uses a combination of `URL` and `w` or `x` descriptors to specify the image.
## Width (`w`) Descriptor

>The `w` descriptor is used to specify the width of the image in pixels. It is used when we want to provide the browser with dimensions for the image that can fit the available screen space.

>The syntax for using the `w` descriptor in `srcset` is as follows:

```html
<img src="small.jpg"
  srcset="small.jpg 500w,
          medium.jpg 1000w,
          large.jpg 2000w"
  alt="Example Image">
```



>In the above example, we have provided the browser with three images and their respective widths in pixels. The browser will select the image that is closest to the available screen space.
## Pixel Density (`x`) Descriptor

>The `x` descriptor is used to specify the pixel density of the image, which is the ratio of physical pixels to CSS pixels. It is used when we want to provide the browser with different versions of the same image with different pixel densities.

>The syntax for using the `x` descriptor in `srcset` is as follows:

```html
<img src="small.jpg"
  srcset="small.jpg 1x,
          medium.jpg 2x,
          large.jpg 3x"
  alt="Example Image">
```


>In the above example, we have provided the browser with three images and their respective pixel densities. The browser will select the image with the pixel density that is closest to the device screen.

>Note that the `w` and `x` descriptors can be used together in the same `srcset` attribute to provide more choices to the browser.
