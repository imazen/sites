Learn about width (`w`) and density (`x`) descriptors in `srcset`. Use examples and Markdown.

> `srcset` is an HTML attribute that allows developers to provide multiple image sources with different resolutions or pixel densities, and lets the browser select the appropriate image based on the device's display characteristics. The `srcset` attribute uses combinations of `URL` and `w` or `x` descriptors to specify images.

## Width Descriptors (`w`)

> The `w` descriptor is used to specify the pixel width of an image. We use it when we want to provide the browser with the size of the image so that it can choose the appropriate image based on the available screen space.

> The syntax for using the `w` descriptor in `srcset` is as follows:

```html
<img src="small.jpg"
  srcset="small.jpg 500w,
          medium.jpg 1000w,
          large.jpg 2000w"
  alt="Example Image">
```



> In the example above, we provide three images and their corresponding pixel widths. The browser will choose the image closest to the available screen space.

## Density Descriptors (`x`)

> The `x` descriptor is used to specify the pixel density of an image, which is the ratio of physical pixels to CSS pixels. We use it when we want to provide different versions of the same image with different pixel densities to the browser.

> The syntax for using the `x` descriptor in `srcset` is as follows:

```html
<img src="small.jpg"
  srcset="small.jpg 1x,
          medium.jpg 2x,
          large.jpg 3x"
  alt="Example Image">
```


> In the example above, we provide three images and their corresponding pixel densities. The browser will choose the image closest to the pixel density of the device's screen.

> Note that the `w` and `x` descriptors can be used together in the same `srcset` attribute to provide more options to the browser.
