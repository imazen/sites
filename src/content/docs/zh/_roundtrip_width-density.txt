Understanding width (`w`) and density (`x`) descriptors in `srcset`. Use examples and Markdown.

> `srcset` is an HTML attribute that allows developers to provide multiple image sources with different resolutions or pixel densities, and lets the browser select the appropriate image based on the display characteristics of the device. The `srcset` attribute specifies images using a combination of `URL` and `w` or `x` descriptors.

## Width (`w`) Descriptor

> The `w` descriptor is used to specify the width of the image in pixels. It is used when we want to provide the browser with image dimensions so that it can select an appropriate image for the available screen space.

> The syntax for using the `w` descriptor in `srcset` is as follows:

```html
<img src="small.jpg"
  srcset="small.jpg 500w,
          medium.jpg 1000w,
          large.jpg 2000w"
  alt="Example Image">
```

> In the above example, we provide the browser with three images and their corresponding pixel widths. The browser will select the image with a width closest to the available screen space.

## Density (`x`) Descriptor

> The `x` descriptor is used to specify the pixel density of the image, which is the ratio of physical pixels to CSS pixels. It is used when we want to provide the browser with different pixel density versions of the same image.

> The syntax for using the `x` descriptor in `srcset` is as follows:

```html
<img src="small.jpg"
  srcset="small.jpg 1x,
          medium.jpg 2x,
          large.jpg 3x"
  alt="Example Image">
```

> In the above example, we provide the browser with three images and their corresponding pixel densities. The browser will choose the image with a pixel density that is closest to the device's screen.

> Note that `w` and `x` descriptors can be used together in the same `srcset` attribute to offer more choices to the browser.

{{Mistakes or Clumsy Phrasing}}

1. "{{示例图像}}" was translated as "Example Image". The term is appropriately translated.
2. The use of quotations and other simple phrases are correctly translated and maintain the integrity of the original content.
