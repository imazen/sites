Srcset with density descriptors provides a simple and effective way to provide the most appropriate image for each user's device, improving performance and user experience. This guide will walk you through using srcset with density descriptors and provide you with markup examples.

## What is Srcset with Density Descriptors?

Srcset is an HTML attribute designed to allow you to specify multiple image sources for a single `<img>` element. Density descriptors (`x`) are used in conjunction with srcset to provide images of different resolutions based on the user's display pixel density.

## When to Use Srcset with Density Descriptors

Srcset with density descriptors is especially useful in the following scenarios:

1. Providing high-resolution images for high-DPI displays such as Retina displays, while providing low-resolution images for standard displays. 
2. Improving page performance by providing the most suitable image size for each user's device.

## Implementing Srcset with Density Descriptors

To use srcset with density descriptors, follow these steps:

1. Prepare your images at different resolutions.
2. Add the `srcset` attribute to the `<img>` element, including the image sources and their corresponding density descriptors.
3. (Optional) Add the `sizes` attribute to specify how the image will be displayed on the screen.

### Markup Example

Here is an example of how to implement srcset with density descriptors in your markup:

```html
<img src="example-image-1x.jpg"
     srcset="example-image-1x.jpg 1x, example-image-2x.jpg 2x, example-image-3x.jpg 3x"
     alt="An example image">
```

This markup example includes:

- **src**: The default image source that is used if the browser doesn't support srcset.
- **srcset**: A list of image sources and their density descriptors (1x, 2x, 3x) to enable selection of the most appropriate image based on the user's display.
- **alt**: A description of the image to be used for accessibility purposes.

That's it! You have successfully implemented srcset with density descriptors, improving your website's performance and user experience.
