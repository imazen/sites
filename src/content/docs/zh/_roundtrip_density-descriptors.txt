Using density descriptors with srcset provides a simple and effective way to deliver the most suitable image for each user’s device, thereby enhancing performance and user experience. This guide will walk you through the basic elements of using srcset with density descriptors and provide markup examples for your convenience.

## What is Srcset with Density Descriptors?

Srcset is an HTML attribute designed to specify multiple image sources for a single `<img>` element. Density descriptors (`x`) are used in conjunction with srcset to provide images of different resolutions based on the pixel density of the user’s display.

## When to Use Srcset with Density Descriptors

Using srcset with density descriptors is particularly useful in the following cases:
1. Providing high-resolution images for high DPI displays (e.g., Retina displays) while supplying low-resolution images for standard displays.
2. Improving page performance by delivering the most appropriate image size for each user’s device.

## Implementing Srcset with Density Descriptors

To use srcset with density descriptors, follow these steps:
1. Prepare images of different resolutions.
2. Add the `srcset` attribute to the `<img>` element, including image sources and their respective density descriptors.
3. Optionally, add the `sizes` attribute to specify the display size of the image on the screen.

### Markup Example

Here's an example of how to implement srcset with density descriptors in markup:

```html
<img src="example-image-1x.jpg"
     srcset="example-image-1x.jpg 1x, example-image-2x.jpg 2x, example-image-3x.jpg 3x"
     alt="An example image">
```

This markup example includes:
- **src**: The default image source displayed if the browser does not support srcset.
- **srcset**: A list of image sources and their density descriptors (1x, 2x, 3x). The browser will choose the most appropriate image based on the user’s display.
- **alt**: An image description provided for accessibility purposes.

That's it! You have successfully implemented srcset with density descriptors, boosting your site’s performance and user experience.
