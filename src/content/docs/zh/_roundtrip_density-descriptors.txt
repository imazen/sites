Srcset with density descriptors provides a simple and effective way to serve the most appropriate image for each user's device, improving performance and user experience. This guide will walk you through how to use srcset with density descriptors and provide you with some markup examples.

## What is Srcset with Density Descriptors?

Srcset is an HTML attribute designed to allow you to specify multiple image sources for a single `<img>` element. When used in conjunction with density descriptors (`x`), srcset provides different resolution images based on your user’s display pixel density.

## When to Use Srcset with Density Descriptors

Using srcset with density descriptors is particularly useful when:

1. Providing high-resolution images for high-DPI displays, like Retina displays, while serving low-resolution images for standard displays.

2. Improving page performance by serving the most appropriate image size for each user’s device.

## Implementing Srcset with Density Descriptors

To use srcset with density descriptors, follow these steps:

1. Prepare images at different resolutions.

2. Add the `srcset` attribute to your `<img>` element, including the image sources and their respective density descriptors.

3. (Optional) Add a `sizes` attribute to specify the display size of the image.

### Markup Example

Here is an example of how to implement srcset with density descriptors in your markup:

```html
<img src="example-image-1x.jpg"
     srcset="example-image-1x.jpg 1x, example-image-2x.jpg 2x, example-image-3x.jpg 3x"
     alt="An example image">
```

This markup example includes:
- **src**: The default image source to display if the browser doesn't support srcset.
- **srcset**: A comma-separated list of image sources and their density descriptors (1x, 2x, 3x), allowing the browser to choose the most appropriate image based on your user's display.
- **alt**: A description of the image, used for accessibility purposes.

That's it! You have successfully implemented srcset with density descriptors, improving your website's performance and user experience.
