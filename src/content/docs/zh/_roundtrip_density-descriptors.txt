Srcset and density descriptors offer a simple and effective way to deliver the most appropriate image to each user's device, thereby improving performance and user experience. This guide will cover how to use srcset with density descriptors and provide code examples.

## What is srcset with density descriptors?

Srcset is an HTML attribute designed to allow you to specify multiple image sources for a single `<img>` element. Density descriptors (`x`) are used in conjunction with srcset to provide different resolution images based on a user's display pixel density.

## When to use srcset with density descriptors

Srcset with density descriptors is particularly useful for:
1. Providing high-resolution images for high-DPI displays (such as Retina displays) while providing low-resolution images for standard displays.
2. Improving page performance by providing the most appropriate image size to each user's device.

## Implementing srcset with density descriptors

To use srcset with density descriptors, follow these steps:
1. Prepare images of different resolutions.
2. Add the `srcset` attribute to the `<img>` element, including the image sources and their corresponding density descriptors.
3. Add the `sizes` attribute (optional) to specify the image's display size on the screen.

### Code example

Here's an example of how to implement srcset with density descriptors in your code:

```html
<img src="example-image-1x.jpg"
     srcset="example-image-1x.jpg 1x, example-image-2x.jpg 2x, example-image-3x.jpg 3x"
     alt="An example image">
```

This code example includes:
- **src**: the default image source, displayed if the browser does not support srcset.
- **srcset**: a list of image sources and their density descriptors (1x, 2x, 3x). The browser will choose the most appropriate image based on the user's display.
- **alt**: an image description used for accessibility.

That's it! You have successfully implemented srcset with density descriptors, improving your website's performance and user experience.
