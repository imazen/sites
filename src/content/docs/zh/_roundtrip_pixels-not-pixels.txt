### Device Pixels ≠ Browser Pixels ≠ Image Pixels

Thanks to Apple, CSS and HTML pixels (`px`) **almost always map to multiple device/printer pixels**. My phone has a device pixel ratio of 3.875; [what's yours?](https://www.mydevice.io/)

The device pixel ratio of my desktop changes when the browser zooms, but it is 1.5 by default (after all, my `System > Display > Scale` is set to 150%).

Image files (excluding SVGs) get decoded into pixel grids. **It's very difficult to get image pixels to display perfectly at a 1:1 ratio on device pixels, but with `srcset`, you can get pretty close**. If you really have a legitimate reason for a perfect map, some JavaScript can adjust the HTML element size after loading, but we won't get into the details of this taboo art here.

> Other absolute units (such as in, pc, pt, mm, cm, Q) are represented in CSS pixel counts, pretending that everything is at 96dpi. Developers avoid using absolute units because it's usually best to use units derived from font size or viewport/container size. Units that don't match may break the layout if the user adjusts their `Accessibility > Text Size` multiplier, zooms the browser, or rotates their device. Needless to say, you should perform all of these operations before publishing your website.
