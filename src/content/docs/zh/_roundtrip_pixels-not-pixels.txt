### Device Pixels ≠ Browser Pixels ≠ Image Pixels

Thanks to Apple, CSS and HTML pixels (`px`) **almost always map to more than one device/printer pixel**. My phone's devicePixelRatio is 3.875; [what's yours?](https://www.mydevice.io/)

The devicePixelRatio of my desktop device varies with browser zooming, but defaults to 1.5 (after all, I have `System > Display > Scale` set to 150%).

Image files (except SVGs) are decoded into pixel grids. **It's hard to get image pixels to display perfectly at a 1:1 ratio with device pixels, but with `srcset` you can get close enough**. If you do have a reason for this perfect mapping, some JavaScript can adjust the size of HTML elements after loading, though such forbidden skills are not demonstrated here.

> Other absolute units (in, pc, pt, mm, cm, Q) are defined in terms of a quantity of CSS pixels and pretend everything is 96dpi. Developers avoid absolute units since it's better to use units derived from font sizes or viewport/container dimensions. Mismatched units can break layouts if users adjust their `Accessibility > Text Size` multiplier, zoom the browser, or rotate their device. Needless to say, you should perform all these operations before publishing your site.
