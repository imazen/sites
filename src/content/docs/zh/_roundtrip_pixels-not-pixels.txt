### Device Pixels ≠ Browser px ≠ Image px

Thanks to Apple, CSS and HTML pixels (`px`) **almost always map to multiple device/printer pixels**. The devicePixelRatio on my phone is 3.875; [what about yours?](https://www.mydevice.io/)

The devicePixelRatio on my desktop changes with browser zoom, but the default is 1.5 (after all, my `system > display > scale` is 150%).

Image files (excluding SVGs) are decoded into a pixel grid. **Getting image pixels to perfectly display on device pixels at a 1:1 ratio is tricky - but you can get close to perfect using `srcset`**. If you have a truly reasonable reason for needing a perfect map, a bit of JavaScript can adjust the sizes of html elements after loading, although these dark arts won't be revealed here.

> Other absolute [units (inches, picas, pt, mm, cm, Q)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/length) are defined in terms of CSS pixels, pretending everything is 96dpi. Developers avoid using absolute units because it's usually better to use units derived from font sizes or viewport/container sizes. If a user adjusts their `accessibility > text size` multiplier, zooms the browser, or rotates the device, a mismatch in units can break layouts. Needless to say, you should do all these things before you publish your website.

{{Note that the term "禁术" is used, and its translation is "dark arts", which seems to be a humorous or informal usage not typically present in technical documents.}}
