### Device Pixels ≠ Browser Pixels ≠ Image Pixels

Thanks to Apple, CSS and HTML Pixels (`px`) **map to multiple device/printer pixels almost every time**. My phone's device pixel ratio is 3.875; [what's yours?](https://www.mydevice.io/)

My desktop's device pixel ratio changes with browser zoom, but is by default 1.5 (after all, my `System > Display > Scale` is set to 150%).

Image files (excluding SVG) decode into pixel grids. **It's hard to get image pixels to display at a 1:1 ratio on device pixels, but `srcset` gets you pretty close to perfect**. If you do have a legitimate reason for a perfect mapping, some JavaScript can adjust HTML element sizes after loading, but we won't get into the details of this black art here.

> Other absolute units (such as in, pc, pt, mm, cm, Q) are represented with a number of CSS pixels, pretending that everything is 96dpi. Developers will avoid absolute units as it's usually better to use units derived from font size or viewport/container size. Mismatched units can break layouts if the user adjusts their `Accessibility > Text Size` multiplier, zooms in the browser, or rotates their device. Needless to say, you should test all of these before launching your site.
