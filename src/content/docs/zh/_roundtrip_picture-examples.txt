Provides several examples of using the `<picture>` element and explains each example briefly:

1. Example of responsive images:

```html
<picture>
  <source srcset="image-large.jpg" media="(min-width: 768px)" />
  <source srcset="image-medium.jpg" media="(min-width: 480px)" />
  <img src="image-small.jpg" alt="An image" />
</picture>
```

Explanation: In this example, the `<picture>` element is used to provide different image sources based on screen size. The `<source>` element uses the `srcset` and `media` attributes to specify which source should be used under which conditions. The `<img>` element serves as a fallback option for older browsers or when none of the conditions specified in the `<source>` element are met.

2. Example of art direction:

```html
<picture>
  <source srcset="image-wide.jpg" media="(orientation: landscape)" />
  <img src="image-portrait.jpg" alt="An image" />
</picture>
```

Explanation: In this example, the `<picture>` element provides different image sources based on the device's orientation. The `media` attribute in the `<source>` element is set to "(orientation: landscape)", specifying a wide image resource, while the `<img>` element specifies a portrait image resource.

3. Example of different image formats:

```html
<picture>
  <source srcset="image.webp" type="image/webp" />
  <source srcset="image.png" type="image/png" />
  <img src="image.jpg" alt="An image" />
</picture>
```

Explanation: In this example, the `<picture>` element provides different image sources based on different image formats. The `<source>` elements use the `srcset` and `type` attributes to specify different image sources with different formats. The `<img>` element serves as a fallback option for older browsers that do not support the `<picture>` element.
