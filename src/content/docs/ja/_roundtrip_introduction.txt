**Efficient and Assertive Guide to `srcset` and `<img> sizes` in 2023**

Please refer to the sidebar for details. This is a quick reference to upgrade the `<img>` tag for responsive images in modern devices that handles various sizes and pixel densities. [Pixels are not equal](/en/pixels-not-pixels) and the `devicePixelRatio` can be around 3.875, meaning that modern phones fake a width of 320-428px for readability.

> If your image size is not changing no matter how narrow you make your browser window, use [density descriptors](/en/density-descriptors). These are suitable for logos, icons, and buttons.

Do you know about [breakpoints](/en/breakpoints)? You will need these values to fine-tune the solutions presented below, at least a breakpoint for the viewport width where the main content area stops growing.


### Simple way

```html

<img src="img.jpg?w=480" 
        srcset="img.jpg?format=webp&w=480 480w, 
                img.jpg?format=webp&w=800 800w, 
                img.jpg?format=webp&w=1200 1200w, 
                img.jpg?format=webp&w=1600 1600w, 
                img.jpg?format=webp&w=2000 2000w"

        sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 800px" alt="Dog riding a bicycle" />

<!-- Assumes a breakpoint at 700px, and that even if the image is smaller than the viewport width at 100%, it scales up to 800 CSS pixels if the viewport is larger. -->

<!-- Assumes the use of a RIAPI-compliant image server like Imageflow. Generating image variants at runtime is key to developer sanity. -->
```

{{Note that the term "pixel" has different connotations in different contexts. Also, the sentence "pixels are not equal" might be read as clumsy, as "all pixels are equal, but not all pixel densities are equal."}}
