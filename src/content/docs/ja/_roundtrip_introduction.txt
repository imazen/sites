**Efficient and Opinionated Guide on Images in 2023**

Check the sidebar for more details. This is a quick reference for upgrading the `<img>` tag to handle devices with different modern sizes and pixel densities. You should be aware that [pixels are not always equal to pixels](/en/pixels-not-pixels), and `devicePixelRatio` is closer to 3.875 than 1:1. Modern phones perform as though they are 320-428px wide (in CSS pixels) for readability, but they have many device pixels per CSS pixel.

> If the image size never changes, irrespective of how narrow the browser window gets, you should [use density descriptors](/en/density-descriptors). This is often appropriate for logos, icons, and buttons.

Do you know your [breakpoints](/en/breakpoints)? You will need those figures to fine-tune the solution below. At a minimum, the breakpoint is the viewport width at which the main content area's growth stops.

### Simple Method

```html

<img src = "img.jpg?w=480" 
        srcset="img.jpg?format=webp&w=480 480w, 
                img.jpg?format=webp&w=800 800w, 
                img.jpg?format=webp&w=1200 1200w, 
                img.jpg?format=webp&w=1600 1600w, 
                img.jpg?format=webp&w=2000 2000w"

        sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 800px" alt="Dog riding a bicycle" />

<!-- Assuming there's a breakpoint at a viewport width of 700px.
      Below this viewport width, this image will take 100% of the width,
      but as the viewport gets larger, the image will be constrained to 800 CSS pixels -->

<!-- Assuming you are using an RIAPI-compliant image server (like Imageflow).
     On-the-fly image variant creation is essential for developer sanity. -->
```

**Notes**:

1. {{Note that the term "RIAPI" could be more clearly defined or spelled out as its relevant field might not use it commonly as an acronym.}}
2. {{The word "sanity" when referring to developers might not be the best choice of words; it could be replaced with something like "ease of development" or "developer convenience."}}
