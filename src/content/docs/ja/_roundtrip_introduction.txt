**An Efficient and Assertive Guide for Responsive Images in 2023**

Please see the sidebar for details. This is a quick reference for upgrading your `<img>` tags to accommodate the various sizes and pixel densities of modern devices. Keep in mind that [pixels are not pixels](/en/pixels-not-pixels) and that `devicePixelRatio` can be closer to 3.875 than 1:1. Modern phones pretend to be between 320-428px wide for legibility.

> If images are not resizing no matter how small the browser window is, you will need to use [density descriptors](/en/density-descriptors). These are best for logos, icons, buttons, etc.

Do you know your [breakpoints](/en/breakpoints)? You will need those numbers to tweak the following solutions. At minimum, you'll need a breakpoint for the width of the viewport, where the main content area stops growing.


### The easy way

```html
<img src="img.jpg?w=480" 
        srcset="img.jpg?format=webp&w=480 480w, 
                img.jpg?format=webp&w=800 800w, 
                img.jpg?format=webp&w=1200 1200w, 
                img.jpg?format=webp&w=1600 1600w, 
                img.jpg?format=webp&w=2000 2000w"

        sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 800px" alt="Dog riding a bike" />

<!-- Here, we assume a breakpoint of 700px. If the viewport is below that, the image takes up 100% width.
If it's larger, the image size is capped at 800 CSS pixels. -->

<!-- This also assumes you're using an RIAPI-compliant image server like Imageflow 
that generates image variants on-the-fly, which is developer sanity-preserving. -->
```
