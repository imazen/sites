**Efficient and Opinionated Guide to Images for 2023**

See the sidebar for details. This is a quick reference for upgrading the `<img>` tag to handle the various sizes and pixel densities of modern devices. You need to know [pixels aren't pixels](/en/pixels-not-pixels) and that `devicePixelRatio` is often greater than 1:1. Phones today pretend to have between 320-428px (CSS pixels) for readability, but many device pixels per CSS pixel are available.

>If your image sizes don't change no matter how narrow you make your browser window, you should use [density descriptors](/en/density-descriptors) instead. These are suitable for logos, icons, buttons, and the like.

Do you know your [breakpoints](/en/breakpoints)? You will need those numbers to fine-tune the solutions below. At a minimum, you need the breakpoint at which the main content area stops growing in viewport width.


### The Easy Way

```html
<img src="img.jpg?w=480" 
     srcset="img.jpg?format=webp&amp;w=480 480w,
             img.jpg?format=webp&amp;w=800 800w,
             img.jpg?format=webp&amp;w=1200 1200w,
             img.jpg?format=webp&amp;w=1600 1600w,
             img.jpg?format=webp&amp;w=2000 2000w"
     sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 800px"
     alt="Dog riding a bicycle"
/>

<!--Assumes a breakpoint at 700px.
    Below that viewport width, the image fills 100% of the width,
    but above that, the image is limited to 800 CSS pixels. -->

<!--Assumes use of an RIAPI-compliant image server like Imageflow.
    Instant generation of variant images is essential for developer sanity.-->
