**An Efficient and Idiosyncratic Guide to Images for 2023**

Check out the sidebar. It’s a quick reference for upgrading your `<img>` tags to handle all the various sizes and pixel densities of modern devices. You’ll need to [know that pixels aren't pixels](/en/what-is-a-pixel) and understand that `devicePixelRatio` is often more like 3.875:1 than 1:1. Modern phones might mimic CSS pixels of 320-428px wide for legibility, but they have many device pixels per CSS pixel.


> If your image won't change size no matter how narrow you make the browser window, [consider using density descriptors](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Multimedia_and_embedding/Responsive_images#density_descriptors). This is great for logos, icons, and buttons.


Do you know your [breakpoints](/en/responsive-images#breakpoints)? You'll need those numbers to fine-tune this solution. At least you'll need the breakpoint of the viewport width where the main content area stops growing.


### The Easy Way

```html

<img src="img.jpg?w=480" 
        srcset="img.jpg?format=webp&w=480 480w, 
                img.jpg?format=webp&w=800 800w, 
                img.jpg?format=webp&w=1200 1200w, 
                img.jpg?format=webp&w=1600 1600w, 
                img.jpg?format=webp&w=2000 2000w"

        sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 800px" alt="Dog riding bike" />

<!--Assumes you have a breakpoint at 700px,
  and if the viewport width is narrower than that, this image takes up 100% width,
  but if it’s wider, then it's capped at 800 CSS pixels. -->

<!--This assumes you're using an RIAPI-compliant image server,
  for the sake of developer sanity, on-the-fly image variations are essential.-->
```
