### Device Pixels ≠ Browser Pixels ≠ Image Pixels

Thanks to Apple, CSS and HTML pixels (`px`) are **almost always mapped to multiple device/printer pixels**. The `devicePixelRatio` on my phone is 3.875. [What's yours?](https://www.mydevice.io/)

The `devicePixelRatio` on a desktop varies with the browser zoom, but it's usually 1.5 by default (mine is 150% under `System> Display> Scale`).

Image files (excluding SVGs) are decoded to a grid of pixels. **It's very hard to display image pixels perfectly in a 1:1 ratio with device pixels, but you can get close enough with `srcset`**. If a perfect mapping is necessary for legitimate reasons though, you can adjust the size of the HTML element after loading with a little bit of JavaScript. But we won't reveal these dark arts here.

> Other absolute units (`in`, `pc`, `pt`, `mm`, `cm`, `Q`) assume a certain number of CSS pixels and 96dpi. Developers should avoid absolute units because it's generally better to use units derived from font size or viewport/container dimensions. Mismatched units can break layouts when users adjust the multiplier for `Accessibility > Text Size`, browser zoom, or device rotation. Needless to say, all these should be done before shipping the site.
