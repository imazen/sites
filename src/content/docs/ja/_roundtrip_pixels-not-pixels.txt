### Device Pixels ≠ Browser px ≠ Image px

Thanks to Apple, CSS and HTML pixels (`px`) **almost always map to multiple device/printer pixels**. The devicePixelRatio of my phone is 3.875. [What about yours?](https://www.mydevice.io/)

The devicePixelRatio of my desktop changes with browser zoom, but it's 1.5 by default (since `System > Display > Scale` is at 150%).

Image files (except SVGs) are decoded into a grid of pixels. **Perfectly displaying image pixels in a 1:1 ratio with device pixels is annoyingly difficult, but with `srcset` you can get *pretty close***. If you need that perfect mapping for a legitimate reason, you can adjust the size of HTML elements after loading with a bit of JavaScript, but such forbidden techniques won't be revealed here.

> Other absolute [units (in, pc, pt, mm, cm, Q)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/CSS/length) are defined by the number of CSS pixels, all pretending to be at 96dpi. Developers generally avoid absolute units and prefer using units derived from font size or viewport/container dimensions. If units don't match, layouts might break when users adjust magnification in `Accessibility > Text Size`, zoom the browser, or rotate the device. Needless to say, all these should be checked before shipping the site.

{{Note that the italicized phrase *pretty close* might be seen as informal.}}
