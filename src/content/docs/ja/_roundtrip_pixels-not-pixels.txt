### Device pixels ≠ Browser pixels ≠ Image pixels

Thanks to Apple, CSS and HTML pixels (`px`) map to **multiple device/printer pixels almost all the time**. The `devicePixelRatio` on my mobile phone is 3.875, what's yours? [Find out here](https://www.mydevice.io/)

The `devicePixelRatio` of a desktop varies with browser zoom, but defaults to 1.5 (mine is upped to 150% under `System > Display > Scale`).

Image files (excluding SVG) are decoded onto a pixel grid. **It is very hard to display image pixels perfectly at a 1:1 ratio with device pixels, but using `srcset` can get you close enough**. If there's a legitimate reason for needing a perfect mapping, a bit of JavaScript can adjust the size of the HTML element after loading. However, we won't delve into such frowned upon techniques here.

> Other absolute units (`in`, `pc`, `pt`, `mm`, `cm`, `Q`) are assumed to represent a number of CSS pixels, which all happen to be 96dpi. Developers should avoid absolute units. Because it's generally better to use units derived from font size or viewport/container dimensions. Mismatched units could break the layout if the user adjusts the multiplicative factor of `Accessibility > Text Size`, browser zoom, or rotates the device. Needless to say, all of these should be done before shipping the site.
