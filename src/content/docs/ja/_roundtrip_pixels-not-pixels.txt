### Device Pixel ≠ Browser Pixel ≠ Image Pixel

Thanks to Apple, CSS and HTML pixels (`px`) now **nearly always map to multiple device/printer pixels**. The devicePixelRatio on my smartphone is 3.875. [What's yours?](https://www.mydevice.io/)

The devicePixelRatio of a desktop varies with browser zoom, but defaults to 1.5 as it's scaled to 150%.

Image files (excluding SVGs) decode to a pixel grid. **Displaying image pixels perfectly at a 1:1 device pixel ratio is very difficult, but using `srcset` yields sufficiently close results**. If there's a truly compelling reason, a little JS can be used to adjust an element's size after it loads, but such forbidden techniques will not be revealed here.

> Other absolute units (`in`,` pc`, `pt`,` mm`, `cm`,` Q`) relate to numbers of CSS pixels and are treated as though all are 96dpi. Because it's generally better to use units derived from font size or viewport/container dimensions, developers tend to avoid absolute units. If a user adjusts the "Accessibility> Text size" multiplier, zooms the browser, or rotates the device, layout may break if the units don't match. Of course, all of these should be done before shipping the site.
