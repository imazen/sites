Using density descriptors with `srcset` provides a simple and effective way to deliver the best image for each user's device, improving performance and user experience. In this guide, we will explain the basics of using density descriptors with `srcset` and provide convenient markup examples.

## What is Srcset with Density Descriptors?

Srcset is an HTML attribute designed to specify multiple image sources for a single `<img>` element. Density descriptors (`x`) are used with Srcset to provide images of different resolutions based on the pixel density of a user's display.

## When to Use Srcset with Density Descriptors

Using Srcset with density descriptors is particularly useful when: 
1. You want to provide high-resolution images for high-DPI displays (such as Retina displays), while providing low-resolution images for standard displays. 
2. You want to improve page performance by delivering the optimal image size for each user's device.

## Implementing Srcset with Density Descriptors

Follow these steps to use Srcset with density descriptors: 
1. Prepare images with different resolutions. 
2. Add the `srcset` attribute to the `<img>` element, including the image sources and their corresponding density descriptors. 
3. (Optional) Add the `sizes` attribute to specify the size of the image displayed on the screen.

### Markup Example

The following is an example of how to implement Srcset with density descriptors in markup:

```html
<img src="example-image-1x.jpg"
     srcset="example-image-1x.jpg 1x, example-image-2x.jpg 2x, example-image-3x.jpg 3x"
     alt="An example image">
```

This markup example includes: 

- **src**: The default image source displayed if the browser does not support srcset. 
- **srcset**: A list of image sources and their density descriptors (1x, 2x, 3x). The browser selects the optimal image based on the user's display. 
- **alt**: A description of the image for accessibility purposes.

With these steps, implementation of Srcset with density descriptors is complete, and site performance and user experience have been improved.
