## What is Srcset with Density Descriptors?

Srcset with Density Descriptors is an HTML attribute that allows to specify multiple image sources for a single `<img>` element using density descriptors (`x`), which are combined with the `srcset` attribute to provide images of different resolutions based on the pixel density of the user's display.

## When to use Srcset with Density Descriptors?

Using Srcset with Density Descriptors is particularly useful in the following cases:

1. Providing high-resolution images to high DPI displays (e.g. Retina displays) while also providing low-resolution images to standard displays.
2. Providing optimal image sizes for each user's device to improve page performance.

## Implementing Srcset with Density Descriptors

To use Srcset with Density Descriptors, follow these steps:

1. Prepare the images at different resolutions.
2. Add the `srcset` attribute to the `<img>` element, including the image sources and their corresponding density descriptors.
3. If the size of the displayed image needs to be specified, add the optional `sizes` attribute.

### Example Markup

The following is an example of using density descriptors in the `srcset` attribute in markup:

```html
<img src="example-image-1x.jpg"
     srcset="example-image-1x.jpg 1x, example-image-2x.jpg 2x, example-image-3x.jpg 3x"
     alt="An example image">
```

This markup example includes the following:

- **src**: the default image source that will be displayed by the browser if it does not support `srcset`.
- **srcset**: a list of image sources and their corresponding density descriptors (1x, 2x, 3x). The browser selects the optimal image based on the user's display.
- **alt**: a description of the image for accessibility purposes.

That's it! You have successfully implemented Srcset with Density Descriptors, improving the performance and user experience of your website.
