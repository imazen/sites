Using a Srcset with density descriptors provides a simple and effective way to deliver the best image to each user's device, improving performance and user experience. This guide explains the basics of using density descriptors with Srcset and provides an example markup to implement it.

## What is a Srcset with Density Descriptors?

Srcset is an HTML attribute designed to specify multiple image sources for a single `<img>` element. Density descriptor (`x`) is used with Srcset to provide images of different resolutions based on the user's display pixel density.

## When to Use a Srcset with Density Descriptors

Using a Srcset with density descriptors is particularly useful in the following cases:
1. When you want to provide high-resolution images to high DPI displays (such as Retina displays), while providing low-resolution images to standard displays.
2. When you want to improve page performance and provide the best image size for each user's device.

## Implementing a Srcset with Density Descriptors

To use a Srcset with density descriptors, follow these steps:
1. Prepare images of different resolutions.
2. Add the `srcset` attribute to the `<img>` element and include the image source with its corresponding density descriptor.
3. (Optionally) add the `sizes` attribute to specify the size at which the image will be displayed on the screen.

### Example Markup

Here is an example of how to implement a Srcset with density descriptors in markup:

```html
<img src="example-image-1x.jpg"
     srcset="example-image-1x.jpg 1x, example-image-2x.jpg 2x, example-image-3x.jpg 3x"
     alt="An example image">
```

This markup example includes the following:
- **src**: The default image source displayed if the browser does not support the `srcset`.
- **srcset**: A list of image sources and their density descriptors (1x, 2x, 3x). The browser selects the optimal image based on the user's display.
- **alt**: A description of the image for accessibility purposes.

With this implementation of a Srcset with density descriptors, website performance and user experience have been improved.

Content prompt used: 
Translate the following to Japanese, preserving all markdown formatting.
        Don't translate html elements or URLs, but do change 'en' to 'ja' inside link addresses.
        Inside code blocks, only translate comments

Metadata prompt used: 
Also carefully translate the title and description for the article:
1. Density descriptors & srcset
 2. Examples of using density descriptors in `srcset` 


Roundtrip (isolated) prompt used: 
Translate the following to english, preserving all markdown, code blocks, and links. After the translation, list any mistakes or clumsy phrasing or grammar inside brackets, such as {{Note that the term used here is not the technical term...}}.
