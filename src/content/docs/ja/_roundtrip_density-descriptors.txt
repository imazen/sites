Using srcset with high-density descriptors is a simple and effective way to provide optimal images for the user's device, enhancing both performance and user experience. This guide explains the basics of using high-density descriptors with srcset and provides helpful markup examples.

## What is Srcset with High-Density Descriptors?

Srcset is an HTML attribute that specifies multiple image sources for a single `<img>` element. Density descriptors (`x`) are used in combination with srcset to provide images of different resolutions based on the display's pixel density.

## When to Use Srcset with High-Density Descriptors

It is particularly useful to use srcset with high-density descriptors in the following cases:
1. When you want to provide high-resolution images for high DPI displays (e.g., Retina displays) while providing low-resolution images for standard displays.
2. When you want to enhance page performance by supplying the optimal image size for each user's device.

## Implementing Srcset with High-Density Descriptors

To use srcset with high-density descriptors, follow these steps:
1. Prepare images at different resolutions.
2. Add the `srcset` attribute to the `<img>` element, including image sources and their corresponding density descriptors.
3. Optionally add the `sizes` attribute to specify the displayed size of the image on the screen.

### Markup Example

Below is an example of how to implement srcset with high-density descriptors in your markup:

```html
<img src="example-image-1x.jpg"
     srcset="example-image-1x.jpg 1x, example-image-2x.jpg 2x, example-image-3x.jpg 3x"
     alt="Example image">
```

This markup example includes:
- **src**: The default image source displayed if the browser does not support srcset.
- **srcset**: A list of image sources and their density descriptors (1x, 2x, 3x) for selecting the optimal image based on the user's display.
- **alt**: A description of the image to improve accessibility.

And that's it! By implementing srcset with high-density descriptors, you've successfully improved your website's performance and user experience.

{{Note that "High-Density Descriptors" might not be the technical term most broadly understood. "Density Descriptors" suffices to describe the '1x', '2x', etc., within "srcset". "High-Density Descriptors" suggests all usages are for high-resolution outcomes.}}
