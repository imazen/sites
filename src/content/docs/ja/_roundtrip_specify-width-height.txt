Why is it necessary to specify width and height in HTML code?

> It is recommended to specify the width and height attributes in HTML code for images. This is to help web browsers know the size of the image before it is fully loaded. With this information, the browser can reserve the appropriate space for the image in the web page, preventing content from jumping when the image is loaded.
>
> Additionally, specifying the width and height of an image can improve the overall performance of your web page. With the browser knowing the size of the image beforehand, it can more accurately calculate the space needed to display the image, avoiding unnecessary repositioning or redrawing of content while it is loaded.
>
> Ultimately, using the width and height attributes in HTML code for images can speed up content loading, reduce visual anomalies, and enhance user experience.
