What are the reasons to include width and height attributes in HTML?

> It is recommended to include width and height attributes for images in HTML code. This is because the web browser can allocate the appropriate space for the image on the webpage by knowing the size of the image before it is fully loaded. This prevents content from jumping during the loading of the image.

> Furthermore, specifying the width and height attributes of images can improve the performance of the entire webpage. If the browser knows the size of the image in advance, it can calculate the space required to display the image accurately and avoid unnecessary reflows or repaints during loading.

> In general, using the width and height attributes for images in HTML code can speed up content loading, reduce visual defects, and improve the user experience.
