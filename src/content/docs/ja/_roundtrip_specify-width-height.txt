What is the reason for specifying the width and height in HTML?

> It is recommended to specify the `width` and `height` attributes of images in HTML code. This is because web browsers can recognize the size of the image before it is fully loaded. By doing this, you can ensure proper space for images on the web page and prevent content from jumping during image loading.
>
> In addition, specifying the width and height of an image can also improve the overall performance of the web page. If the browser already knows the size of the image, it can more accurately calculate the space required to display the image, thus avoiding unnecessary redrawing during loading of the page content.

> By specifying the `width` and `height` attributes of images in HTML code, you can shorten the loading time of the content, reduce visual issues, and enhance the overall user experience.
