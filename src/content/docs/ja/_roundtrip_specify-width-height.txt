Why Should You Specify Width and Height in HTML?

> The reason it is recommended to specify width and height attributes for images in HTML code is so that web browsers can know the size of the image before fully loading it. This allows the browser to allocate appropriate space for the image on the web page, preventing content from jumping around when the image loads.
>
> Additionally, specifying width and height attributes for an image can improve the overall performance of the web page. When the browser knows the size of the image in advance, it can more accurately calculate the space needed for display, avoiding unnecessary reflows and repaints during content loading.
>
> Overall, using width and height attributes in an image's HTML code can speed up content loading and reduce visual glitches, thereby improving user experience.

Mistakes or Clumsy Phrasing:
- {{The instruction in the title to avoid using &, <, or > was not part of the original content in Japanese. It was part of the instruction to translate the title and description.}}
- {{The title and description translation could be perceived as slightly vague. The title "Using Width and Height" could have been more specific, such as "The Importance of Using Width and Height in HTML."}}
- {{The description is translated well, but it could be rephrased for improved readability as "The Advantages of Defining Width and Height Attributes in HTML Code."}}
