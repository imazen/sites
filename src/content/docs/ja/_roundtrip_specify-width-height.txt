What is the reason for specifying width and height in HTML? 

> It is recommended to specify width and height in HTML code before the web browser has fully loaded the image size. This allows the browser to reserve the appropriate space for the image in the web page. As a result, it prevents content from jumping as the image is being loaded.
>
> Furthermore, by specifying the width and height of the image, overall performance of the web page can be improved. If the browser is aware of the image size in advance, it can more accurately calculate the necessary space required to display the image, and thus avoid unnecessary reflows or redraws as content is being loaded.
>
> By specifying the width and height of an image in HTML code, the loading of the content becomes faster and visual glitches are reduced, thereby improving the user experience.
