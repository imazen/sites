Understanding width (w) and density (x) descriptors in `srcset`. Explained using examples in Markdown format.

> `srcset` is one of the HTML attributes that allows developers to provide multiple image sources with varying resolutions and pixel densities, enabling the browser to select the appropriate image based on the device's display characteristics. The `srcset` attribute specifies images by combining `URL` with `w` or `x` descriptors.

## Width (`w`) Descriptor

> The `w` descriptor is used to specify the width of an image in pixels. It is used when you want to provide the browser with the dimensions of the image so that it can select the most suitable image according to the available screen space.

> The syntax for using the `w` descriptor in `srcset` is as follows:

```html
<img src="small.jpg"
  srcset="small.jpg 500w,
          medium.jpg 1000w,
          large.jpg 2000w"
  alt="Example Image">
```

> In the example above, three images with their widths in pixels are provided to the browser. The browser selects the image with the width closest to the available screen space.

## Density (`x`) Descriptor

> The `x` descriptor is used to specify the pixel density of an image. This is the ratio of physical pixels to CSS pixels. It is used when you want to provide different versions of the same image at different pixel densities to the browser.

> The syntax for using the `x` descriptor in `srcset` is as follows:

```html
<img src="small.jpg"
  srcset="small.jpg 1x,
          medium.jpg 2x,
          large.jpg 3x"
  alt="Example Image">
```

> In the example above, three images with their pixel densities are provided to the browser. The browser selects the image with the pixel density closest to the device's screen.

> Note: You can combine `w` and `x` descriptors in the `srcset` attribute to broaden the range of selections for the browser.
