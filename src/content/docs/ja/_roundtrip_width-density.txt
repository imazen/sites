Understanding width (`w`) and density (`x`) descriptors in `srcset`. Explained in markdown format with examples.

>`srcset` is an HTML attribute that allows developers to provide multiple image sources with different resolutions and pixel densities, so that the browser can select the appropriate image according to the device's display characteristics. The `srcset` attribute specifies the image using a combination of `URL` and the `w` or `x` descriptor.

## Width (`w`) descriptor

>The `w` descriptor is used to specify the width of the image in pixels. It provides the dimensions of the image to the browser so that it can choose the appropriate image that fits the available screen space.

>The syntax for using the `w` descriptor in `srcset` is as follows:

```html
<img src="small.jpg"
     srcset="small.jpg 500w,
             medium.jpg 1000w,
             large.jpg 2000w"
     alt="Example Image">
```

> In the example above, we provide the browser with three images and their corresponding widths in pixels. The browser selects the image with the closest width according to the available screen space.

## Density (`x`) descriptor

>The `x` descriptor is used to specify the pixel density of the image, which is the ratio between physical pixels and CSS pixels. It is used when different versions of the same image with different pixel densities need to be provided to the browser.

>The syntax for using the `x` descriptor in `srcset` is as follows:

```html
<img src="small.jpg"
     srcset="small.jpg 1x,
             medium.jpg 2x,
             large.jpg 3x"
     alt="Example Image">
```

> In the example above, we provide the browser with three images and their pixel densities. The browser selects the image with the pixel density closest to the device's screen.

>Note that width and density descriptors can be used together in the same `srcset` attribute, which increases the options that the browser can choose from.
