Understand the width (w) and density (x) descriptors in `srcset`, using examples and Markdown.

The `srcset` attribute is an HTML attribute that allows developers to provide multiple image sources with different resolutions and pixel densities, so that the browser can select the appropriate image based on the device's display characteristics. The `srcset` attribute specifies an image using a combination of a URL and a `w` or `x` descriptor.

## Width (w) Descriptor

The `w` descriptor is used to specify the width of an image in pixels. It provides the browser with the dimensions of the image, allowing it to choose an image that best fits the available screen space.

The syntax for using the `w` descriptor in `srcset` is as follows:

```html
<img src="small.jpg"
  srcset="small.jpg 500w,
          medium.jpg 1000w,
          large.jpg 2000w"
  alt="Example Image">
```

In the above example, three images are provided to the browser, along with their respective widths in pixels. The browser selects the image with the closest width to the available screen space.

## Density (x) Descriptor

The `x` descriptor is used to specify the pixel density of an image, which is the ratio of physical pixels to CSS pixels. It is used when providing different versions of the same image with different pixel densities to the browser.

The syntax for using the `x` descriptor in `srcset` is as follows:

```html
<img src="small.jpg"
  srcset="small.jpg 1x,
          medium.jpg 2x,
          large.jpg 3x"
  alt="Example Image">
```

In the above example, three images are provided to the browser, along with their respective pixel densities. The browser selects the image with the closest pixel density to the device's screen.

Both `w` and `x` descriptors can be used together within the same `srcset` attribute, providing the browser with choices.
