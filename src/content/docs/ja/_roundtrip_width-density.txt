Understand the width (`w`) and density (`x`) descriptors in `srcset`. Use examples and Markdown.

> `srcset` is an HTML attribute that provides multiple image sources with different resolutions or pixel densities, allowing the browser to select the appropriate image based on the device's display characteristics. The `srcset` attribute specifies an image using a combination of a URL and either a `w` or an `x` descriptor.

## Width (`w`) Descriptor

> The `w` descriptor is used to specify the width of the image in pixels. It is used when providing the dimensions of an image to the browser to serve an image that fits the available screen space.

> The syntax for using the `w` descriptor in `srcset` is as follows:

```html
<img src="small.jpg"
  srcset="small.jpg 500w,
          medium.jpg 1000w,
          large.jpg 2000w"
  alt="Example Image">
```

> In the example above, three images and their corresponding pixel widths are provided to the browser. The browser selects the image with the closest width to the available screen space.

## Density (`x`) Descriptor

> The `x` descriptor is used to specify the pixel density of the image, which is the ratio of physical pixels to CSS pixels. It is used when serving different versions of the same image with different pixel densities to the browser.

> The syntax for using the `x` descriptor in `srcset` is as follows:

```html
<img src="small.jpg"
  srcset="small.jpg 1x,
          medium.jpg 2x,
          large.jpg 3x"
  alt="Example Image">
```

> In the example above, three images and their corresponding pixel densities are provided to the browser. The browser selects the image with the closest pixel density to the device's screen.

> The `w` descriptor and the `x` descriptor can be used together in the `srcset` attribute to provide the browser with more options for selection.
