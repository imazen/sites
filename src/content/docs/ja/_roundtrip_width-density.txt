Understanding the `width` (`w`) and `density` (`x`) descriptors in `srcset`. Explanation with examples using Markdown.

>`srcset` is an HTML attribute that provides multiple image sources with different resolutions and pixel densities, so that the browser can choose the appropriate image based on the device's display characteristics. The `srcset` attribute specifies images using a combination of a `URL` and either a `w` or `x` descriptor.

## Width (`w`) Descriptor

>The `w` descriptor is used to specify the width of an image in pixels. It is used when the dimensions of the image need to be provided to the browser to select an image that is appropriate for the available screen space.

>The syntax to use the `w` descriptor in `srcset` is as follows:

```html
<img src="small.jpg"
  srcset="small.jpg 500w,
          medium.jpg 1000w,
          large.jpg 2000w"
  alt="Example Image">
```

> In the example above, three images and their corresponding widths in pixels have been specified to the browser. The browser will select the image with the closest width to the available screen space.

## Density (`x`) Descriptor

>The `x` descriptor is used to specify the pixel density of an image, which is the ratio of physical pixels to CSS pixels. It is used when different versions of the same image with different pixel densities need to be provided to the browser.

>The syntax to use the `x` descriptor in `srcset` is as follows:

```html
<img src="small.jpg"
  srcset="small.jpg 1x,
          medium.jpg 2x,
          large.jpg 3x"
  alt="Example Image">
```

> In the example above, three images and their corresponding pixel densities have been specified to the browser. The browser will select the image with the pixel density closest to the screen of the device.

>The `w` and `x` descriptors can be used together in the same `srcset` attribute to provide options to the browser.
