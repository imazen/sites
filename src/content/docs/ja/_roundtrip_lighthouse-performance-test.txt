3. In the Developer Tools panel, click the `Lighthouse` icon on the left side of the panel, or open the command menu by pressing "Ctrl+Shift+P" (Windows, Linux) or "Command+Shift+P" (macOS), type "Lighthouse," and select "Generate report."

4. In the Lighthouse dialog box, select the relevant options for the performance you want to test, then click "Generate report."
