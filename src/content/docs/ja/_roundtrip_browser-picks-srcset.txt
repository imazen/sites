How does a browser select which image to display from those listed in the `srcset` attribute? We'll explain step-by-step, providing examples for both width and density descriptors based on device and viewport. 

When using the `srcset` attribute in HTML, the browser uses a set of rules to select the optimal image from the provided list of sources. These rules depend on the display characteristics of the device (resolution, pixel density) and the size of the viewport. The `srcset` attribute allows specifying different images based on width (`w` descriptor), or based on pixel density (`x` descriptor). Let's explain with examples for each case: 

1. Width descriptor (`w`):

Assume we have the following `srcset` attribute: 

```html
<img src="example-small.jpg" srcset="example-small.jpg 400w, example-medium.jpg 800w, example-large.jpg 1600w" alt="Example Image">
```
The browser follows these steps: 

a. Determine the device's DPR (Device Pixel Ratio). For example, the standard display has a DPR of 1, and high-resolution (Retina) displays have a DPR of 2 or more.

b. Calculate the effective width for each image in `srcset` by multiplying its width descriptor by the DPR. For devices with a DPR of 1, they would be as follows:

- example-small.jpg: 400 * 1 = 400px

- example-medium.jpg: 800 * 1 = 800px

- example-large.jpg: 1600 * 1 = 1600px

c. Compare each effective width with the viewport width. The browser chooses the smallest image with an effective width larger than the viewport width. In this case, `example-medium.jpg` would be chosen if the viewport width is assumed to be 420px.

2. Density descriptor (`x`):

Assume we have the following `srcset` attribute: 

```html
<img src="example-1x.jpg" srcset="example-1x.jpg 1x, example-2x.jpg 2x, example-3x.jpg 3x" alt="Example Image">
```

The browser follows these steps:

a. Determine the device's DPR (Device Pixel Ratio). For example, the standard display has a DPR of 1, and high-resolution (Retina) displays have a DPR of 2 or more.

b. Compare each image's `x` descriptor in `srcset` with the device's DPR. In this case, there are three images with descriptors:

- example-1x.jpg: 1x

- example-2x.jpg: 2x

- example-3x.jpg: 3x

c. The browser chooses the image with the closest descriptor to the device's DPR. With a DPR of 1, the browser will choose `example-1x.jpg`. With a DPR of 2, the browser will choose `example-2x.jpg`. 

When using width descriptors (`w`), you can also provide detailed information about how the image should be displayed on different viewport widths by combining the `sizes` and `srcset` attributes. Here's an example: 

```html
<img src="example-small.jpg" srcset="example-small.jpg 400w, example-medium.jpg 800w, example-large.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, (max-width: 960px) 50vw,
```
