Below are examples of using the `<picture>` element and their explanation:

1. Example of responsive images:

```html
<picture>
  <source srcset="image-large.jpg" media="(min-width: 768px)" />
  <source srcset="image-medium.jpg" media="(min-width: 480px)" />
  <img src="image-small.jpg" alt="An image" />
</picture>
```

Explanation: In this example, the `<picture>` element is used to provide different image sources for different screen sizes. The `<source>` elements specify the conditions under which each source is used by using the "srcset" attribute and the "media" attribute. The `<img>` element is used as a fallback for older browsers or when the conditions specified in the `<source>` elements are not met.

2. Example of art direction:

```html
<picture>
  <source srcset="image-wide.jpg" media="(orientation: landscape)" />

  <img src="image-portrait.jpg" alt="An image" />
</picture>
```

Explanation: In this example, the `<picture>` element is used to provide different image sources depending on the device orientation. The `<source>` element with the "media" attribute set to "(orientation: landscape)" specifies an image source for landscape mode screens, while the `<img>` element specifies an image source for portrait mode screens.

3. Example of different image formats:

```html
<picture>
  <source srcset="image.webp" type="image/webp" />

  <source srcset="image.png" type="image/png" />

  <img src="image.jpg" alt="An image" />
</picture>
```

Explanation: In this example, the `<picture>` element is used to provide different image sources for different image formats. The `<source>` elements specify the image format using the "srcset" and "type" attributes. The `<img>` element is used as a fallback for older browsers not supporting the `<picture>` element.

## Breakpoints

In responsive design, breakpoints are used to change the layout of a website or application based on the size of the viewport. Breakpoints are typically defined using CSS media queries to apply different styles depending on the screen width. These breakpoints can be used in conjunction with the `<picture>` element to provide image sources suitable for different screen sizes.

For example, in the first example above, the `media` attribute is used to specify the screen width at which each source is used. When the screen width is 768 pixels or more, the `image-large.jpg` source is used; when the screen width is 480 pixels or more but less than 768 pixels, the `image-medium.jpg` source is used; and when the screen width is less than 480 pixels, the `image-small.jpg` source is used. This way, images of suitable size are provided for each device, reducing page load time and improving user experience.

Breakpoints can be defined for any screen size, and multiple breakpoints can be used to create layouts that accommodate various devices. By combining breakpoints with the `<picture>` element, you can create flexible and responsive designs that look good on any device.
