Below are examples and explanations for using the `<picture>` element:

1. Example of a responsive image:

```html
<picture>
  <source srcset="image-large.jpg" media="(min-width: 768px)" />
  <source srcset="image-medium.jpg" media="(min-width: 480px)" />
  <img src="image-small.jpg" alt="An image" />
</picture>
```

Explanation: In this example, the `<picture>` element is used to provide different image sources for different screen sizes. The `<source>` element specifies the conditions for using each source using the `srcset` and `media` attributes. The `<img>` element is used as a fallback for older browsers or if the conditions specified in the `<source>` element are not met.

2. Example of art direction:

```html
<picture>
  <source srcset="image-wide.jpg" media="(orientation: landscape)" />
  <img src="image-portrait.jpg" alt="An image" />
</picture>
```

Explanation: In this example, the `<picture>` element is used to provide different image sources depending on the device's orientation. The `<source>` element with the `media` attribute set to `(orientation: landscape)` specifies the image source for wide screens, while the `<img>` element specifies the image source for portrait screens.

3. Example of different image formats:

```html
<picture>
  <source srcset="image.webp" type="image/webp" />
  <source srcset="image.png" type="image/png" />
  <img src="image.jpg" alt="An image" />
</picture>
```

Explanation: In this example, the `<picture>` element is used to provide different image sources for different image formats. The `<source>` element uses the `srcset` and `type` attributes to specify the image format. The `<img>` element is used as a fallback for older browsers that do not support the `<picture>` element.

## Breakpoints

In responsive design, breakpoints define when a website or application's layout changes based on the size of the viewport. Breakpoints are typically defined using CSS media queries, which apply different styles based on screen width. These breakpoints can be used in combination with the `<picture>` element to provide different image sources for different screen sizes.

For example, in the first example, the `media` attribute is used to specify the screen width for each source. If the screen width is 768 pixels or larger, the `image-large.jpg` source is used. If the screen width is between 768 and 480 pixels, the `image-medium.jpg` source is used. If the screen width is 480 pixels or smaller, the `image-small.jpg` source is used. This allows for providing appropriately sized images for each device, reducing page load times, and improving the user experience.

Breakpoints can be defined for any screen size and using multiple breakpoints can create layouts for a wide variety of devices. By combining breakpoints with the `<picture>` element, responsive and flexible designs with great visual appearance can be created on any device.
