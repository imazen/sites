Here are some examples that demonstrate how to use the `<picture>` element:

1\. Example for responsive images:

```html
 <picture>
   <source srcset="image-large.jpg" media="(min-width: 768px)" />
   <source srcset="image-medium.jpg" media="(min-width: 480px)" />
   <img src="image-small.jpg" alt="An image" />
 </picture>
```

Explanation: In this example, the `<picture>` element is used to provide different image sources for different screen sizes. The `<source>` element specifies different image sources using the "srcset" attribute and the "media" attribute, which specify the conditions for which each resource is used. The `<img>` element is used as a fallback for older browsers or when the conditions specified in the `<source>` element are not met.

2\. Example for art direction:

```html
 <picture>
   <source srcset="image-wide.jpg" media="(orientation: landscape)" />
   <img src="image-portrait.jpg" alt="An image" />
 </picture>
```

Explanation: In this example, the `<picture>` element is used to provide different image sources depending on the device orientation. The `<source>` element with the "media" attribute set to "(orientation: landscape)" specifies an image source for wide screens, while the `<img>` element specifies an image source for portrait screens.

3\. Example for different image formats:

```html
 <picture>
   <source srcset="image.webp" type="image/webp" />
   <source srcset="image.png" type="image/png" />
   <img src="image.jpg" alt="An image" />
 </picture>
```

Explanation: In this example, the `<picture>` element is used to provide different image sources for different image formats. The `<source>` element specifies different image sources for different formats using the "type" attribute and the "srcset" attribute. The `<img>` element is used as a fallback for older browsers that do not support the `<picture>` element.
