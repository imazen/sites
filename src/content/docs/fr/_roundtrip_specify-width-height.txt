Why should you use width and height in HTML? 

> It is recommended to include the `width` and `height` attributes in the HTML code of images as it allows the web browser to know the size of the image before it's fully loaded. This allows the browser to reserve the appropriate space on the web page for the image, preventing content from jumping around the image during loading.
> 
> Additionally, specifying `width` and `height` attributes for images can also contribute to overall web page performance. When a browser knows the size of an image in advance, it can more accurately calculate the amount of space required to display the image and avoid unnecessary content reflows or repaints during loading.
> 
> In general, the use of `width` and `height` attributes in HTML code for images can improve the user experience by allowing faster loading of content and reducing visual issues.
