Why should width and height be included in HTML? 

> It is recommended to use the width and height attributes in HTML code for images because it helps the web browser to know the size of the image before it's fully loaded. This allows the browser to reserve the appropriate space on the web page for the image, preventing content from jumping around while the image is loading.
>
> Additionally, specifying the width and height of images can also help improve the overall performance of the web page. When a browser knows the size of an image in advance, it can more accurately calculate the space needed to display the image and avoid unnecessary reflows or repaints of content during its loading.
>
> Overall, using the width and height attributes in HTML code for images can enhance the user experience by making content load faster and reducing visual issues.
