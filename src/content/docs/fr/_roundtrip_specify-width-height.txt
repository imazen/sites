Why Should You Specify Width and Height in HTML?

> It is recommended to include width and height attributes in the HTML code for images because this helps the web browser understand the size of the image before it is fully loaded. This allows the browser to allocate the appropriate amount of space on the webpage for the image, preventing content from shifting as the image loads.
>
> Additionally, specifying width and height attributes for images can also help improve the overall performance of the webpage. When a browser knows the size of an image in advance, it can more accurately calculate the amount of space needed to display the image and avoid unnecessary reflows or repaints of the content during loading.
>
> In summary, using width and height attributes in the HTML code for images can enhance the user experience by making content load faster and reducing visual disturbances.
