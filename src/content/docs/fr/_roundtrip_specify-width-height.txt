Why should you put width and height in HTML code?

> It is recommended to add the width and height attributes in the HTML code of images because it helps the web browser to know the size of the image before it is fully loaded. This allows the browser to reserve the appropriate space on the web page for the image, preventing content from jumping around while the image loads.
>
> Additionally, specifying the width and height attributes for images can also help improve the overall performance of the web page. When a browser knows the size of an image beforehand, it can more accurately calculate the amount of space needed to display the image and avoid unnecessary reflows or repaints of the content during loading.
> 
> Overall, using width and height attributes in HTML code for images can improve the user experience by speeding up content loading and reducing visual issues.
