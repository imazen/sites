Why should you include width and height in HTML?

> It is recommended to include width and height attributes in the HTML code of images because it helps the web browser to know the size of the image before it is fully loaded. This allows the browser to reserve the appropriate space on the web page for the image, which prevents content from jumping around while the image is loading.
> 
> Additionally, specifying width and height attributes for images can also contribute to overall web page performance. When a browser knows the size of an image in advance, it can accurately calculate the amount of space needed to display the image and avoid unnecessary reloads or redraws of content during loading.
> 
> In summary, the use of width and height attributes in HTML code for images can improve the user experience by speeding up content loading and reducing visual issues.
