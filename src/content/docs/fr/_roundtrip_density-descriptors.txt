Srcset with density descriptors provides a simple and effective method for providing the most appropriate image for each user's device, thus improving performance and the user experience. This guide will walk you through the essentials of using srcset with density descriptors and provide markup examples for your convenience.

## What is Srcset with density descriptors?

Srcset is an HTML attribute designed to allow you to specify multiple image sources for a single `<img>` element. Density descriptors (`x`) are used in conjunction with srcset to provide images of different resolutions based on the pixel density of the user's screen.

## When to use Srcset with density descriptors?

Using srcset with density descriptors is particularly useful when you want to:
1. Serve high-resolution images on high-DPI screens (e.g. Retina displays) while providing lower resolution images to standard screens.
2. Improve page performance by providing the most appropriate image size to each user's device.

## Implementation of Srcset with density descriptors

To use srcset with density descriptors, follow these steps:
1. Prepare your images at different resolutions.
2. Add the `srcset` attribute to the `<img>` element, including the image sources and corresponding density descriptors.
3. Add the `sizes` attribute (optional) to specify the image size as it will be displayed on the screen.

### Markup example

Here is an example implementation of srcset with density descriptors in your markup:

```html
<img src="example-image-1x.jpg"
     srcset="example-image-1x.jpg 1x, example-image-2x.jpg 2x, example-image-3x.jpg 3x"
     alt="An example image">
```

This markup example includes:
- **src**: The default image source, displayed if the browser does not support srcset.
- **srcset**: The list of image sources and their density descriptors (1x, 2x, 3x). The browser will choose the most appropriate image based on the user's screen.
- **alt**: A description of the image for accessibility purposes.

And there you have it! You have successfully implemented srcset with density descriptors, improving the performance and user experience of your website.
