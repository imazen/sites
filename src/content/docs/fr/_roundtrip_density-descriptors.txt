Srcset with density descriptors provides a simple and effective method to deliver the most appropriate image for each user's device, improving performance and user experience. This guide will walk you through the essentials of using srcset with density descriptors and provide markup examples for your convenience.

## What is Srcset with density descriptors?

Srcset is an HTML attribute designed to allow you to specify multiple image sources for a single `<img>` element. Density descriptors (`x`) are used in conjunction with srcset to provide images of different resolution based on the user's display pixel density.

## When to use Srcset with density descriptors

Using srcset with density descriptors is particularly useful when you want to:
1. Serve high-resolution images to high pixel density displays (e.g. Retina displays) while providing lower resolution images to standard displays.
2. Improve page performance by delivering the most appropriate image size to each user's device.

## Implementing Srcset with density descriptors

To use srcset with density descriptors, follow these steps:
1. Prepare your images in different resolutions.
2. Add the `srcset` attribute to the `<img>` element, including the image sources and corresponding density descriptors.
3. Add the `sizes` attribute (optional) to specify the image size as it will be displayed on-screen.

### Markup Example

Here is an example of implementing srcset with density descriptors in your markup:

```html
<img src="example-image-1x.jpg"
     srcset="example-image-1x.jpg 1x, example-image-2x.jpg 2x, example-image-3x.jpg 3x"
     alt="An example image">
```

This markup example includes:
- **src**: The default image source, displayed if the browser does not support srcset.
- **srcset**: The list of image sources and their density descriptors (1x, 2x, 3x). The browser will select the most appropriate image based on the user's display.
- **alt**: A description of the image for accessibility purposes.

And there you have it! You have successfully implemented srcset with density descriptors, improving the performance and user experience of your website.
