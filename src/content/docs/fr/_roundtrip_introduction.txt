**An effective and categorical guide to images in 2023**

Check out the sidebar for a deep dive. This is a quick reference to upgrading your `<img>` tags to handle modern devices in all their various sizes and pixel densities. You should [know that pixels are not equal to pixels](/fr/pixels-not-pixels) and that `devicePixelRatio` is more likely to be in the range of 3.875 than 1:1. Modern phones claim to be anywhere from 320 to 428 pixels wide for legibility reasons.

> If your image never changes size no matter the width of your browser window, you should use a [density descriptor instead](/fr/density-descriptors). This often works for logos, icons, and buttons.

Do you know your [breakpoints](/fr/breakpoints)? You'll need those numbers to fine-tune the solution below - at a minimum, the display-port-width breakpoint where the main content area stops growing.


### The easy way

```html

<img src="img.jpg?w=480" 
        srcset="img.jpg?format=webp&w=480 480w, 
                img.jpg?format=webp&w=800 800w, 
                img.jpg?format=webp&w=1200 1200w, 
                img.jpg?format=webp&w=1600 1600w, 
                img.jpg?format=webp&w=2000 2000w"

        sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 800px" alt="Dog on a bike" />

<!-- We assumed you have a breakpoint at 700px. 
      And that under that display-port width, this image takes 100% width, but 
      above that width, the image is capped at 800 CSS pixels wide -->

<!-- This also assumes you're using an RIAPI-compliant image server such as Imageflow. 
     Dynamic image variant generation is essential for developer sanity. -->
```
