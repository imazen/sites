**An effective and engaging guide to images in 2023**

Check out the sidebar for an in-depth dive. This is the quick reference for upgrading `<img>` tags to handle modern devices in all their varied sizes and pixel densities. You should [know that pixels != pixels](/en/pixels-not-pixels) and that `devicePixelRatio` is more likely to be around 3.875 than 1:1. Modern phones claim to be 320-428px wide for legibility (in CSS pixels) but have many device pixels per CSS pixel.

> If your image never changes size no matter the browser window width, you should use a [density descriptor](/en/density-descriptors) instead. This is often suitable for logos, icons, and buttons.

Do you know your [breakpoints](/en/breakpoints)? You'll need those numbers to refine the solution below - at minimum the breakpoint for the viewport width where the main content area stops growing.


### The easy way

```html

<img src="img.jpg?w=480" 
        srcset="img.jpg?format=webp&w=480 480w, 
                img.jpg?format=webp&w=800 800w, 
                img.jpg?format=webp&w=1200 1200w, 
                img.jpg?format=webp&w=1600 1600w, 
                img.jpg?format=webp&w=2000 2000w"

        sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 800px" alt="Dog riding bike" />

<!-- We assumed you have a breakpoint at 700px. And that below this viewport width, this image takes up 100% of the width, but 
     when the viewport is wider, the image is limited to 800 CSS pixels wide -->

<!-- This assumes that you're using a RIAPI-compliant image server like Imageflow. Creating image variants on-the-fly is 
    essential for developer sanity. -->
```
