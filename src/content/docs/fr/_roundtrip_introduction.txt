**An efficient and subjective guide for images in 2023**

Check the sidebar for a deeper dive. This is a quick reference for updating those `<img>` tags to support modern devices in all their varied sizes and pixel densities. You need to [know that pixels != pixels](/en/pixels-not-pixels) and `devicePixelRatio` is more likely to be around 3.875 than 1:1. Modern phones claim a width of 320 to 428 pixels for legibility (in CSS pixels), but have many pixels per CSS pixel.

> If your image never changes size, no matter how small the browser window gets, you should use a [density descriptor instead](/en/density-descriptors). This often suits logos, icons, and buttons.

Do you know what your [breakpoints](/en/breakpoints) are? You'll need those numbers to refine the solution below, at minimum the display width breakpoint where the main content area stops growing.

### The easy way

```html
<img src="img.jpg?w=480"
     srcset="img.jpg?format=webp&w=480 480w, 
             img.jpg?format=webp&w=800 800w, 
             img.jpg?format=webp&w=1200 1200w, 
             img.jpg?format=webp&w=1600 1600w, 
             img.jpg?format=webp&w=2000 2000w"
     sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 800px" 
     alt="Dog riding bicycle">

<!-- We assumed you have a breakpoint at 700px. 
     And that below this view width, this image takes 100% width, but 
     when the display window is larger, the image is limited to 800 CSS pixels -->

<!-- This assumes you're using a RIAPI-compliant image server such as Imageflow.
     Producing on-the-fly image variants is essential for developer sanity. -->
```
