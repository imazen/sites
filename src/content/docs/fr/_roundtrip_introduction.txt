**An Effective and Convincing Guide to Adaptive Images for 2023**

Check out the sidebar for a deep dive. Here's the quick reference for improving `<img>` tags to handle modern devices in all their varied sizes and pixel densities. You need to [know that pixels != pixels](/en/pixels-not-pixels) and that `devicePixelRatio` is more likely to be around 3.875 than 1:1. Modern phones claim to be 320-428px wide for legibility.

> If your image will never change size, no matter the width of the browser window, you should use a [density descriptor instead](/en/density-descriptors). This is often well-suited for logos, icons, and buttons.

Do you know your [breakpoints](/en/breakpoints)? You'll need those numbers to refine the solution below - at minimum, the breakpoint of the width of the main content area where growth stops.

### The Easy Way

```html
<img src="img.jpg?w=480"
     srcset="img.jpg?format=webp&amp;w=480 480w,
           img.jpg?format=webp&amp;w=800 800w,
           img.jpg?format=webp&amp;w=1200 1200w,
           img.jpg?format=webp&amp;w=1600 1600w,
           img.jpg?format=webp&amp;w=2000 2000w"
     sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 800px"
     alt="Dog riding a bicycle">

<!-- We assumed you have a breakpoint at 700px.
      And that below this display width, this image takes 100% of width, but
      when the display window is bigger, the image is limited to 800 CSS pixels -->

<!-- This also assumes you're using an RIAPI-compliant image server, such as Imageflow.
     The production of image variants on-the-fly is essential for developer sanity. -->
```
