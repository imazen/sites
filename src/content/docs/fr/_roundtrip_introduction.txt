**An efficient and opinionated guide on images for 2023**

Check the sidebar for an in-depth examination. This is the quick reference to update these `<img>` tags to handle modern devices in all their different sizes and pixel densities. You should [know that pixels != pixels](/en/pixels-not-pixels) and `devicePixelRatio` is more likely to be around 3.875 than 1:1. Modern phones claim to be between 320 to 428px wide for readability (in CSS pixels), but have many device pixels per CSS pixel.

> If the image never changes size, no matter how much you shrink the browser window, you should use a [density descriptor instead](/en/density-descriptors). This is often suitable for logos, icons, and buttons.

Do you know your [breakpoints](/en/breakpoints)? You will need these figures to refine the solution below – and at least the breakpoint of the window width where the main content area stops growing.

### The easy method

```html

<img src="img.jpg?w=480" 
        srcset="img.jpg?format=webp&w=480 480w, 
                img.jpg?format=webp&w=800 800w, 
                img.jpg?format=webp&w=1200 1200w, 
                img.jpg?format=webp&w=1600 1600w, 
                img.jpg?format=webp&w=2000 2000w"

        sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 800px" alt="Dog riding a bicycle" />

<!-- We assumed you have a breakpoint at 700px. 
      And that under this window width, this image takes 100% of the width, but
      when the window is wider, the image is limited to 800 CSS pixels -->

<!-- This assumes you are using an image server compliant with RIAPI such as Imageflow.
     Rendering image variants on the fly is essential for developers' peace of mind. -->
```

Mistakes or clumsy phrasing:

- {{Note that "Responsive Images API" is abbreviated as "RIAPI" without any prior explanation within the text. It might be beneficial to clarify this abbreviation for readers unfamiliar with it.}}
- {{The original French phrasing "Un guide efficace et opinionné" translates accurately, but the term "opinionated" may feel slightly negative or subjective to some readers. Consider rephrasing if clarity and tone moderation is important.}}
- {{The term "tranquillité d'esprit" was translated as "peace of mind," which is a common phrase in English and considered a proper equivalent, despite slight variations in literal translation.}}
