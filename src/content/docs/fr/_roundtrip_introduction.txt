**An efficient and partial guide to images for 2023**

Check out the sidebar for more detail. This is a quick reference for improving `<img>` tags to handle new devices with different sizes and pixel densities. You need to [know that pixels != pixels](/pixels-not-pixels) and that `devicePixelRatio` is more likely to be around 3.875 than 1:1. Modern phones pretend to be wide screens of 320 to 428px for better readability (in CSS pixels), but have many device pixels per CSS pixel.

> If your image never changes size, regardless of the width of the browser window, you should use a [density descriptor](/density-descriptors) instead. This is often suitable for logos, icons, and buttons.

Do you know your [breakpoints](/breakpoints)? You will need these numbers to refine the solution below--at a minimum, the breakpoint of the display window width where the main content area stops expanding.


### The Easy Way

```html
<img src="img.jpg?w=480" 
        srcset="img.jpg?format=webp&w=480 480w, 
                img.jpg?format=webp&w=800 800w, 
                img.jpg?format=webp&w=1200 1200w, 
                img.jpg?format=webp&w=1600 1600w, 
                img.jpg?format=webp&w=2000 2000w"
        sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 800px" alt="Dog riding bike" />

<!-- We've assumed you have a breakpoint at 700px. 
      And that below that window width, the image takes 100% of the width, but
      when the display window is greater, the image is limited to 800 CSS pixels. -->

<!-- This assumes you are using a RIAPI-compatible image server such as Imageflow. Generating image variants on the fly is essential for developer sanity. -->
