### Device pixels ≠ browser pixels ≠ image pixels

Thanks to Apple, CSS and HTML pixels (`px`) **almost always correspond to multiple device/printer pixels**. The devicePixelRatio on my phone is 3.875; [what's yours?](https://www.mydevice.io/)

The devicePixelRatio on my desktop changes with browser zoom, but by default, it is 1.5 (my `System > Display > Scale` is 150%, after all).

Image files (excluding SVGs) decode into a pixel grid. **It is extremely difficult to achieve a perfect match at a 1:1 ratio with device pixels - but with `srcset` you can get close enough***, and a bit of JavaScript can adjust the size of the HTML element after loading if you have genuinely justified reasons for needing that perfect match, although these forbidden arts will not be revealed here.

> Other [absolute units (in, pc, pt, mm, cm, Q)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/length) are defined in terms of the number of CSS pixels and claim that everything is at 96dpi. Developers avoid absolute units as it is generally preferable to use units derived from font size or viewport/container dimensions. Incompatible units can break a layout if the user adjusts their `Accessibility > Text Size` multiplier, zooms the browser, or rotates their device. Needless to say, you should do all these things before delivering your site.
