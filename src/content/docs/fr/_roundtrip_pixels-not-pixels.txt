### Device pixels ≠ Browser pixels ≠ Image pixels

Thanks to Apple, CSS and HTML pixels (`px`) **are almost always represented by multiple device/printer pixels**. The `devicePixelRatio` on my phone is 3.875; [what's yours?](https://www.mydevice.io/)

The `devicePixelRatio` of my desktop computer changes based on the browser zoom, but is by default 1.5 (after all my `System > Display > Scale` is set to 150%).

Image files (with the exception of SVG files) are made up of a grid of pixels. **Getting a perfect representation of image pixels at a 1:1 ratio with device pixels is hardly ever achievable, but with `srcset`, you can get close enough,** and a bit of Javascript can adjust the html element size after load if you have perfectly valid reasons for needing this perfect mapping, although such frowned-upon practices won't be disclosed here.

> Other absolute units ([in, pc, pt, mm, cm, Q)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/length) are defined based on the number of CSS pixels and pretend everything is 96 dpi. Developers avoid absolute units as it's generally better to use units derived from font size or viewport/container dimensions. Incompatible units can break a layout if the user adjusts their `Accessibility > Text size` multiplier, zooms the browser, or rotates their device. Needless to say, you should do all of these things before publishing your site.
