**An efficient and strict guide to images for 2023**

Check the sidebar for a detailed explanation. This is a brief reference for updating `<img>` tags for all modern device sizes and pixel resolutions. You should [know that pixels â‰  pixels](/en/pixels-not-pixels) and that `devicePixelRatio` is closer to 3.875 than 1:1. Modern phones pretend to be 320-428px wide for better readability.

> However, if your image is always the same size regardless of how narrow the browser window gets, you should [use a density descriptor](/en/density-descriptors). This is often appropriate for logos, icons, and buttons.

Do you know which [breakpoints](/en/breakpoints) you need? You need these numbers to optimize the solution below and to at least know the breakpoint of the screen width where the main content area stops growing.

### The simple method

```html
<img src="img.jpg?w=480"
     srcset="img.jpg?format=webp&w=480 480w, 
             img.jpg?format=webp&w=800 800w, 
             img.jpg?format=webp&w=1200 1200w, 
             img.jpg?format=webp&w=1600 1600w, 
             img.jpg?format=webp&w=2000 2000w"
     sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 800px"
     alt="Dog rides bicycle"/>

<!-- We assumed you have a breakpoint at 700px. 
     And that the image takes up 100% of the width below that screen width, but 
     is limited to 800 CSS pixels when the screen is larger. -->

<!-- This also assumes that you are using a RIAPI-compliant image server like Imageflow. 
     On-the-fly image variants are essential for developer (and site) health. -->
```
