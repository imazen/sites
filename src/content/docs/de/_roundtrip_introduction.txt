**An efficient and opinionated guide to images for 2023**

Check the sidebar for a deep dive. This is the quick reference to update `<img>` tags to support modern devices with all their various sizes and pixel densities. You should [know that pixels != pixels](/en/pixels-not-pixels) and `devicePixelRatio` is more around 3.875 than 1:1. Modern phones pretend to be 320-428px wide to improve readability (in CSS pixels), but have many device pixels per CSS pixel.

> If your image size never changes, no matter how narrow you make the browser window, you should use a [density descriptor](/en/density-descriptors) instead. This is often suitable for logos, icons, and buttons.

Do you know your [breakpoints](/en/breakpoints)? You'll need these numbers to fine-tune the solution below - and at least the viewport width breakpoint where your main content area stops growing.

### The simple method

```html
<img src="img.jpg?w=480" 
     srcset="img.jpg?format=webp&w=480 480w, 
             img.jpg?format=webp&w=800 800w, 
             img.jpg?format=webp&w=1200 1200w, 
             img.jpg?format=webp&w=1600 1600w, 
             img.jpg?format=webp&w=2000 2000w"

     sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 800px" alt="Dog riding a bicycle" />

<!-- We have assumed that you have a breakpoint at 700px.
     And that below this viewport width, this image occupies 100% of the width, but
     when the viewport is larger, the image is limited to 800 CSS pixels. -->

<!-- This assumes you are using an RIAPI-compatible image server like Imageflow.
     Creating image variants on-the-fly is crucial for developer satisfaction. -->
```
