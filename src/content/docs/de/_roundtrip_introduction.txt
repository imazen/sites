**An efficient and confident guide to images by 2023**

Check the sidebar for the deep dive. This is the quick reference for updating those `<img>` tags to handle modern devices in all their various sizes and pixel densities. You should [know that pixels are not pixels](/en/pixels-not-pixels) and that `devicePixelRatio` is likely to be at 3.875 rather than 1:1. Modern phones claim to be 320-428px wide for readability.

> If your image never changes size no matter how narrow you make the browser window, you should use a [density descriptor](/en/density-descriptors) instead. This is often suitable for logos, icons, and buttons.

Do you know what [breakpoints](/en/breakpoints) you have? You need these numbers to fine-tune the solution below - and at least the viewport breakpoint, where the main content stops growing.

### The easy method

```html

<img src="img.jpg?w=480" 
     srcset="img.jpg?format=webp&amp;w=480 480w, 
             img.jpg?format=webp&amp;w=800 800w, 
             img.jpg?format=webp&amp;w=1200 1200w, 
             img.jpg?format=webp&amp;w=1600 1600w, 
             img.jpg?format=webp&amp;w=2000 2000w"
     sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 800px" alt="Dog riding a bike"/> 

<!-- We assumed you have a breakpoint at 700px. 
     And that below that viewport width, this image takes up 100% width, but when 
     the viewport is larger, the image is capped at 800 CSS pixels -->

<!-- This also assumes you're using an RIAPI-compliant image server like Imageflow. 
     Producing image variants on the fly is essential for developer sanity. -->
