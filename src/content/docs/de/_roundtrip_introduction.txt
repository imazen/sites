**An efficient and thoughtful guide to images in 2023**

See the sidebar for a detailed guide. Here is a quick reference for optimizing `<img>` tags for modern devices with their various sizes and pixel densities. You should know that [Pixel != Pixel](/en/pixels-not-pixels) and `devicePixelRatio` is often more like 3.875 than 1:1. Modern phones act as if they are 320-428px wide (in CSS pixels) for legibility, but have many device pixels per CSS pixel.

> If your image does not change size no matter how narrow you make the browser window, consider using [Density Descriptors](/en/density-descriptors) instead. This is often appropriate for logos, icons, and buttons.

Do you know what your [Breakpoints](/en/breakpoints) are? You will need these numbers to fine-tune the solution below - at least the breakpoint for when the viewport width stops growing.

### The Simple Method

```html
<img
  src="img.jpg?w=480"
  srcset="
    img.jpg?format=webp&w=480 480w,
    img.jpg?format=webp&w=800 800w,
    img.jpg?format=webp&w=1200 1200w,
    img.jpg?format=webp&w=1600 1600w,
    img.jpg?format=webp&w=2000 2000w"
  sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 800px"
  alt="Dog riding a bike"
/>

<!-- We assumed you have a breakpoint at 700px.
     And that under this viewport width, this image takes the full width but
     if the viewport is larger, the image is limited to 800 CSS pixels. -->

<!-- This assumes you are using an RIAPI-compliant image server like Imageflow. 
     On-the-fly image variant creation is essential for developer sanity. -->
```
