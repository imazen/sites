**An efficient and definitive guide to images in 2023**

Check the sidebar for deeper dives. This is the quick reference for updating your `<img>` tags to handle modern devices in all their various sizes and pixel densities. You should [know that pixels are not pixels](/en/pixels-not-pixels) and that `devicePixelRatio` tends to be 3.875 rather than 1:1. Modern phones pretend to be 320-428px wide (in CSS pixels) for legibility, but have many device pixels per CSS pixel.

> If your image size never changes no matter how narrow you make the browser window, consider using a [density descriptor](/en/density-descriptors) instead. This is often suitable for logos, icons, and buttons.

Do you know what your [breakpoints](/en/breakpoints) are? You'll need those numbers to fine-tune the solution below – and at least the viewport breakpoint at which the main content area stops growing.

### The simple method

```html
<img src="img.jpg?w=480"
     srcset="img.jpg?format=webp&w=480 480w,
             img.jpg?format=webp&w=800 800w,
             img.jpg?format=webp&w=1200 1200w,
             img.jpg?format=webp&w=1600 1600w,
             img.jpg?format=webp&w=2000 2000w"
     sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 800px"
     alt="Dog riding a bike" />

<!-- We've assumed that you have a breakpoint at 700px. 
     And that below this viewport width, this image takes up 100% width, but 
     if the viewport is larger than that, the image is capped at 800 CSS pixels -->

<!-- This assumes you're using an RIAPI-compatible image server such as Imageflow. 
     On-the-fly image variant production is essential for developer sanity. -->
```

{{Note that the term "RIAPI" used here is not the technical term, but rather a reference to a specific image server.}}
