**An efficient and definitive guide to images until 2023**

See the sidebar for the detailed analysis. This is the quick reference for updating these `<img>` tags to support modern devices of all sizes and pixel densities. You should [know that pixel ≠ pixel](/en/pixel-not-a-pixel) and `devicePixelRatio` is more likely to be 3.875 than 1:1. Modern phones pretend to be 320-428px wide to improve legibility (in CSS pixels), but have many device pixels per CSS pixel.

> If your image size never changes no matter how narrow you make the browser window, consider using a [density descriptor](/en/density-descriptors) instead. This is often suitable for logos, icons, and buttons.

Do you know what your [breakpoints](/en/breakpoints) are? You’ll need those numbers to fine-tune the solution below – and at least the viewport breakpoint where the main content area stops growing.

### The easy method

```html
<img src="img.jpg?w=480" 
     srcset="img.jpg?format=webp&amp;w=480 480w, 
             img.jpg?format=webp&amp;w=800 800w, 
             img.jpg?format=webp&amp;w=1200 1200w, 
             img.jpg?format=webp&amp;w=1600 1600w, 
             img.jpg?format=webp&amp;w=2000 2000w"
     sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 800px" 
     alt="dog riding on a bike" />

<!-- We assume you have a breakpoint at 700px. 
     And that below that viewport width, this image is 100% wide and
     when the viewport is wider, the image is capped at 800 CSS pixels. -->

<!-- This assumes you’re using an RIAPI-compliant image server like imageflow. 
     Dynamic variant production of images is vital for developer sanity. -->
```
