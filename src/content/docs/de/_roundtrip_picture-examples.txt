Here are a few examples for the usage of the `<picture>` element and their explanations:

1. Example for responsive images:

```html
<picture>
  <source srcset="image-large.jpg" media="(min-width: 768px)" />
  <source srcset="image-medium.jpg" media="(min-width: 480px)" />
  <img src="image-small.jpg" alt="An image" />
</picture>
```

Explanation: In this example, the `<picture>` element is used to provide different image sources for different screen sizes. The `<source>` elements specify the different image sources using the `srcset` attribute and the `media` attribute to define the conditions under which each source should be used. The `<img>` element is used as fallback for older browsers or if the conditions specified in the `<source>` elements are not met. 

2. Example for Art Direction:

```html
<picture>
  <source srcset="image-wide.jpg" media="(orientation: landscape)" />
  <img src="image-portrait.jpg" alt="An image" />
</picture>
```

Explanation: In this example, the `<picture>` element is used to provide different image sources based on the orientation of the device. The `<source>` element with the `media` attribute set to `(orientation: landscape)` specifies an image source for wide screens while the `<img>` element specifies an image source for portrait screens.

3. Example for various image formats:

```html
<picture>
  <source srcset="image.webp" type="image/webp" />
  <source srcset="image.png" type="image/png" />
  <img src="image.jpg" alt="An image" />
</picture>
```

Explanation: In this example, the `<picture>` element is used to provide different image sources for various image formats. The `<source>` elements specify different image sources using the `srcset` attribute and the `type` attribute to define the image format. The `<img>` element is used as fallback for older browsers that do not support the `<picture>` element.

## Breakpoints

In responsive design, breakpoints are used to define when the layout of a website or application should change based on the size of the viewport. Breakpoints are typically defined with media queries in CSS that apply different styles depending on the screen width. These breakpoints can be used in conjunction with the `<picture>` element to provide different image sources for different screen sizes.

In the first example above, we used the `media` attribute to specify the screen width at which each source should be used. If the screen width is greater than or equal to 768 pixels, the `image-large.jpg` source will be used. If the screen width is greater than or equal to 480 pixels but less than 768 pixels, `image-medium.jpg` source will be used. If the screen width is less than 480 pixels, the `image-small.jpg` source will be used. This allows appropriately sized images to be provided for each device, reducing page load times and improving the user experience.

Breakpoints can be defined for any screen size, and multiple breakpoints can be used to create layouts that respond to a wide range of devices. By combining breakpoints with the `<picture>` element, flexible and responsive designs can be created that look great on any device.
