How does the browser select between images listed in the "srcset" attribute? Here is a step-by-step guide with examples for both width and density descriptors and how the browser decides based on the device and viewport.

- When using the "srcset" attribute in HTML, the browser uses a set of rules to select the most suitable image from a list of provided sources. These rules depend on both the display characteristics of the device (resolution, pixel density) and the size of the viewport. The "srcset" attribute allows you to specify different images based on width (using the "w" descriptor) or pixel density (using the "x" descriptor). Let's go through examples for both cases.

1. Width descriptor ("w"):

Assuming we have the following "srcset" attribute:

```html

<img src="example-small.jpg" srcset="example-small.jpg 400w, example-medium.jpg 800w, example-large.jpg 1600w" alt="Example image">

```

The browser will perform the following steps:

a. Determine the DPR (Device Pixel Ratio) of the device. For instance, a standard display has a DPR of 1, while a high-resolution (Retina) display has a DPR of 2 or higher.

b. Calculate the effective width for each image in the "srcset". Multiply the width descriptor by the DPR. For a device with a DPR of 1:

- example-small.jpg: 400 * 1 = 400px

- example-medium.jpg: 800 * 1 = 800px

- example-large.jpg: 1600 * 1 = 1600px

c. Compare the effective widths to the viewport width. Assuming the viewport width is 420px, the browser selects the smallest image whose effective width is greater than or equal to the viewport width. In this case, "example-medium.jpg" is selected.

2. Density descriptor ("x"):

Assuming we have the following "srcset" attribute:

```html

<img src="example-1x.jpg" srcset="example-1x.jpg 1x, example-2x.jpg 2x, example-3x.jpg 3x" alt="Example image">

```

The browser will perform the following steps:

a. Determine the DPR (Device Pixel Ratio) of the device. For instance, a standard display has a DPR of 1, while a high-resolution (Retina) display has a DPR of 2 or higher.

b. Compare the device's DPR with the "x" descriptors in the "srcset". In this case, we have three images with the following descriptors:

- example-1x.jpg: 1x

- example-2x.jpg: 2x

- example-3x.jpg: 3x

c. Select the image with the "x" descriptor closest to the device's DPR. For a device with a DPR of 1, the browser selects "example-1x.jpg". For a device with a DPR of 2, it selects "example-2x.jpg", and so on.

It is important to note that you can also use the "sizes" attribute in combination with the "srcset" attribute to provide further information on how the image should display at different viewport widths. This is particularly useful when using the width descriptor ("w"). Here is an example:

```html

<img src="example-small.jpg" srcset="example-small.jpg 400w, example-medium.jpg 800w, example-large.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, (max-width: 960px) 50vw,
