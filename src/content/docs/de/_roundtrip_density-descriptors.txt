Srcset with density descriptions offers a simple and effective method to deliver the most suitable image to each user device, thereby enhancing performance and user experience. This guide will walk you through the basics of using srcset with density descriptions and provide you with markup examples.

## What is Srcset with Density Descriptions?

Srcset is an HTML attribute that allows you to specify multiple image sources for a single `<img>` element. Density descriptions (`x`) are used along with Srcset to provide images of different resolutions based on the pixel density of the user's screen.

## When to Use Srcset with Density Descriptions?

Using Srcset with density descriptions is particularly useful when you:
1. Want to deliver high-resolution images to displays with high DPI (e.g., Retina displays) while providing standard resolution images to standard displays.
2. Want to improve page performance by providing the image size that is most suitable for the user's device.

## Implementing Srcset with Density Descriptions

To use Srcset with density descriptions, follow these steps:
1. Prepare your images in different resolutions.
2. Add the `srcset` attribute to the `<img>` element, including the image sources and the corresponding density descriptions.
3. Add the `sizes` attribute (optional) to set the size of the image as it appears on screen.

### Markup Example

Here is an example of how you can implement Srcset with density descriptions in your markup:

```html
<img src="example-image-1x.jpg"
     srcset="example-image-1x.jpg 1x, example-image-2x.jpg 2x, example-image-3x.jpg 3x"
     alt="An example image">
```

This markup example includes:
- **src**: The default image source that is displayed if the browser does not support srcset.
- **srcset**: The list of image sources and their density descriptions (1x, 2x, 3x). The browser selects the most suitable image based on the user's display.
- **alt**: A description of the image for accessibility purposes.

And that's it! You have successfully implemented Srcset with density descriptions, improving your website's performance and user experience.
