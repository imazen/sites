Srcset with density descriptors offers a simple and effective way to provide the most suitable image for each user's device, improving performance and user experience. This guide walks you through the basics of using srcset with density descriptors and provides markup examples for your convenience.
## What is srcset with Density Descriptors?

Srcset is an HTML attribute that allows you to specify multiple image sources for a single `<img>` element. Density descriptors (`x`) are used in conjunction with srcset to provide different resolution images based on the pixel density of the user's display.
## When should you use srcset with Density Descriptors?

Using srcset with density descriptors is particularly useful when you want to:
1. Provide high-resolution images on high-resolution displays (e.g. Retina displays) while providing lower-resolution images on standard displays.
2. Improve page performance by providing the appropriate image size for the user's device.
## Implementing Srcset with Density Descriptors

To use srcset with density descriptors, follow these steps:
1. Prepare your images in different resolutions.
2. Add the `srcset` attribute to the `<img>` element, including the image sources and corresponding density descriptors.
3. Add the optional `sizes` attribute to specify the size of the image as it will appear on the screen.
### Markup Example

Here's an example of how you can implement srcset with density descriptors in your markup:

```html
<img src="example-image-1x.jpg"
     srcset="example-image-1x.jpg 1x, example-image-2x.jpg 2x, example-image-3x.jpg 3x"
     alt="An example image">
```



This markup example includes:
- **src**: The default image source displayed if the browser does not support srcset.
- **srcset**: The list of image sources and their density descriptors (1x, 2x, 3x). The browser will choose the most suitable image based on the user's display.
- **alt**: A description of the image for accessibility purposes.

And that's it! You have successfully implemented srcset with density descriptors, improving the performance and user experience of your website.
