Understanding width (`w`) and density (`x`) descriptions in `srcset`. Use examples and utilize markdown.

> `srcset` is an HTML attribute that allows developers to provide multiple image sources with different resolutions or pixel densities and allow the browser to select the appropriate image based on the display properties of the device. The `srcset` attribute uses a combination of `URL` and `w` or `x` descriptions to specify the images.

## Width (`w`) Description

> The `w` description is used to specify the width of an image in pixels. It is used when we want to give the browser the dimensions of an image so that it can select the appropriate image for the available screen space.

> The syntax for using the `w` description in `srcset` is as follows:

```html
<img src="small.jpg"
  srcset="small.jpg 500w,
          medium.jpg 1000w,
          large.jpg 2000w"
  alt="Example image">
```

> In the above example, we have provided the browser with three images and their respective widths in pixels. The browser will choose the image with the nearest width to the available screen space.

## Density (`x`) Description

> The `x` description is used to specify the pixel density of an image, i.e. the ratio of physical pixels to CSS pixels. It is used when we want to provide the browser with different versions of the same image with different pixel densities.

> The syntax for using the `x` description in `srcset` is as follows:

```html
<img src="small.jpg"
  srcset="small.jpg 1x,
          medium.jpg 2x,
          large.jpg 3x"
  alt="Example image">
```

> In the above example, we have provided the browser with three images and their respective pixel densities. The browser will choose the image with the nearest pixel density of the device.

> Note that the `w` and `x` descriptions can be used in the same `srcset` attribute to provide the browser with more choices.
