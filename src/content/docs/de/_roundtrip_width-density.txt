Understanding width (`w`) and density (`x`) descriptors in `srcset`. Use examples and use Markdown.

> `srcset` is an HTML attribute that allows developers to provide multiple image sources with different resolutions or pixel densities and let the browser choose the appropriate image based on the display properties of the device. The `srcset` attribute uses a combination of `URL` and `w` or `x` descriptors to specify the images.

## Width (`w`) Descriptor

> The `w` descriptor is used to indicate the width of an image in pixels. It is used when we want to provide the browser with the dimensions of an image so that it can select the appropriate image for the available screen space.

> The syntax for using the `w` descriptor in `srcset` is as follows:

```html
<img src="small.jpg"
  srcset="small.jpg 500w,
          medium.jpg 1000w,
          large.jpg 2000w"
  alt="Example image">
```

> In the example above, we have provided the browser with three images and their corresponding widths in pixels. The browser selects the image with the nearest width to the available screen space.

## Density (`x`) Descriptor

> The `x` descriptor is used to indicate the pixel density of an image which represents the ratio of physical pixels to CSS pixels. It is used when we want to provide the browser with different versions of the same image with different pixel densities.

> The syntax for using the `x` descriptor in `srcset` is as follows:

```html
<img src="small.jpg"
  srcset="small.jpg 1x,
          medium.jpg 2x,
          large.jpg 3x"
  alt="Example image">
```

> In the example above, we have provided the browser with three images and their corresponding pixel densities. The browser selects the image with the nearest density to the device's screen.

> Note that the `w` and `x` descriptors can be used together in the same `srcset` attribute to give the browser more choices.
