Understanding width (`w`) and density (`x`) adapters in `srcset`. Use examples and markdown.

> `srcset` is an HTML attribute that allows developers to provide multiple image sources with different resolutions or pixel densities and let the browser choose the appropriate image based on the display properties of the device. The `srcset` attribute uses a combination of `URL` and `w-` or `x-` adapters to specify the images.

## Width (`w`) Adapter

> The `w-` adapter is used to indicate the width of an image in pixels. It is used when we want to provide image dimensions to the browser so that it can choose the appropriate image for the available screen space.

> The syntax for using the `w-` adapter in `srcset` looks like this:

```html
<img src="small.jpg"
  srcset="small.jpg 500w,
          medium.jpg 1000w,
          large.jpg 2000w"
  alt="Example Image">
```

> In the above example, we have provided the browser with three images and their corresponding widths in pixels. The browser selects the image with the closest width to the available screen space.

## Density (`x`) Adapter

> The `x-` adapter is used to indicate the pixel density of an image, which is the ratio of physical pixels to CSS pixels. It is used when we want to provide the browser with different versions of the same image with different pixel densities.

> The syntax for using the `x-` adapter in `srcset` looks like this:

```html
<img src="small.jpg"
  srcset="small.jpg 1x,
          medium.jpg 2x,
          large.jpg 3x"
  alt="Example Image">
```

> In the above example, we have provided the browser with three images and their corresponding pixel densities. The browser selects the image with the closest pixel density to the device screen.

> Note that the `w-` and `x-` adapters can be used in the same `srcset` attribute to provide the browser with more options to choose from.
