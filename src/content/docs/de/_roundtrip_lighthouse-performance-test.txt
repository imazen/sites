How do you test the performance of your website with Lighthouse?

> Lighthouse is a tool that can be used to measure the performance, accessibility, and other aspects of a website. To test your website's performance using Lighthouse, follow these steps:
> 
> 1\. Open the Google Chrome web browser and navigate to the page you want to test.
> 
> 2\. Click on the three dots in the upper right corner of the browser window, then select "More Tools" and subsequently "Developer Tools," or simply use the shortcut "Ctrl+Shift+I" (Windows, Linux) or "Command+Option+I" (macOS).
> 
> 3\. Click on the Lighthouse icon located on the left side of the Developer Tools panel, or press "Ctrl+Shift+P" (Windows, Linux) or "Command+Shift+P" (macOS) to open the command menu, then type "Lighthouse" and select "Generate Report."
> 
> 4\. In the Lighthouse dialog box, select the performance and other relevant options you want to test, and then click on "Generate Report."
> 
> 5\. Once Lighthouse has completed its analysis, you will see a report with scores and recommendations for improving the performance, accessibility, and other areas of your website.
> 
> By following these steps, you can use Lighthouse to test and optimize your website's performance, which can help improve user experience and search engine rankings.
