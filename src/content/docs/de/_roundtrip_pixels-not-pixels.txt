### Device Pixels ≠ Browser Pixels ≠ Image Pixels

Thanks to Apple, CSS and HTML pixels (`px`) are **almost always mapped to multiple device/printer pixels**. The devicePixelRatio on my phone is 3.875; [what's yours?](https://www.mydevice.io/).

My desktop devicePixelRatio changes with browser zoom, but defaults to 1.5 (my `System > Display > Scale` is set to 150% after all).

Image files (excluding SVG) are decoded into a grid of pixels. **It's annoyingly hard to perfectly represent image pixels at a 1:1 ratio with device pixels - but with `srcset`, you can get *close enough***, and with a little bit of Javascript, the size of the HTML element can be adjusted after loading if you have a compelling reason for that perfect match, though those forbidden arts are not revealed here.

> Other absolute [units (in, pc, pt, mm, cm, Q)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/length) are defined relative to the number of CSS pixels and assume a 96dpi resolution. Developers avoid absolute units because it's generally better to use units derived from font size or viewport/container dimensions. Mismatched units can break a layout when the user adjusts their `Accessibility > Text Size` multiplier, zooms the browser, or rotates their device. It goes without saying that you should do all these things before you launch your website.
