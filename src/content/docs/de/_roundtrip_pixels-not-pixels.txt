### Device Pixel ≠ Browser Px ≠ Image Px

Thanks to Apple, CSS and HTML pixels (`px`) **almost always map to multiple device/display pixels**. The devicePixelRatio on my phone is 3.875; [what's yours?](https://www.mydevice.io/)

The devicePixelRatio on my desktop changes when I zoom in the browser, but by default, it is 1.5 (after all, my `System > Display > Scale` is 150%).

Image files (except SVG) are decoded into a pixel grid. **It is annoyingly difficult to display image pixels perfectly at a 1:1 ratio with device pixels - but with `srcset` you can get *close enough*, and a bit of JavaScript can adjust the size of the HTML element after loading if you really have justified reasons for this perfect alignment, although such forbidden arts will not be revealed here.

> Other absolute [units (in, pc, pt, mm, cm, Q)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/CSS/length) are defined in terms of the number of CSS pixels and pretend everything is 96dpi. Developers avoid absolute units because it is generally better to use units derived from font size or viewport/container dimensions. Mismatched units can ruin a layout if the user adjusts their `Accessibility > Text size` multiplier, zooms the browser, or rotates their device. Naturally, you should do all these things before publishing your page.

{{Note that the phrase "but with `srcset` you can get *close enough*" uses colloquial phrasing which might not be appropriate for technical documentation. Also, the reference to "forbidden arts" is an informal and possibly confusing metaphor in a technical context.}}
