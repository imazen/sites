### Device Pixels ≠ Browser px ≠ Image px

Thanks to Apple, CSS and HTML pixels (`px`) hardly ever correspond to a single device/printer pixel anymore. The devicePixelRatio on my phone is 3.875; [what's yours?](https://www.mydevice.io/)

My desktop's devicePixelRatio changes when I zoom in/out my browser, but it's usually 1.5 (my `System > Display > Scale` is set to 150%).

Image files (except SVG) decode to a grid of pixels. **It's annoyingly hard to display image pixels perfectly in a 1:1 ratio with device pixels, but with `srcset`, you can get *close enough*, and some JavaScript can adjust the size of HTML elements after load if you really have compelling reasons for a perfect match, although such dark arts won't be revealed here.**

> Other absolute [units (in, pc, pt, mm, cm, Q)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/length) are defined in terms of the number of CSS pixels and pretend as if everything is 96dpi. Developers should avoid absolute units because it's usually better to use units derived from font size or viewport/container dimensions. Inconsistent units can break a layout when the user adjusts the `Accessibility > Text Size` multiplier, the browser zooms, or the device rotates. Of course, you should try out all these things before publishing your website.
