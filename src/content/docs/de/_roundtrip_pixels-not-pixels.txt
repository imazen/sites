### Device Pixels ≠ Browser Pixels ≠ Image Pixels

Thanks to Apple, CSS and HTML pixels (`px`) almost never correspond to a single device/printer pixel. The `devicePixelRatio` on my phone is 3.875; [how high is yours?](https://www.mydevice.io/) 

My desktop `devicePixelRatio` changes as I zoom in on the browser, but it is typically 1.5 (my `System > Display > Scale` is set to 150%, after all).

Image files (except for SVG) decode to a grid of pixels. **Unfortunately, it is difficult to display image pixels perfectly at a 1:1 ratio with device pixels -- but with `srcset`, you can get *close enough*, and some JavaScript can adjust the size of the HTML element after it loads if you have a really compelling reason for perfect parity, though such black arts will not be revealed here.**

> Other absolute [units (in, pc, pt, mm, cm, Q)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/length) are defined in terms of the number of CSS pixels they represent, pretending that everything is 96dpi. Developers should generally avoid absolute units, opting for units that derive from font size or viewport/container dimensions. Mismatched units can break a layout when the user adjusts the `Accessibility > Text Size` multiplier, when the browser zooms, or when the device is rotated. Of course, you should test all of these things before publishing your site.
