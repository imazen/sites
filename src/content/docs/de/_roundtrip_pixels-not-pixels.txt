### Device Pixels ≠ Browser Pixels ≠ Image Pixels

Thanks to Apple, CSS and HTML pixels (`px`) **hardly ever equal a single device/printer pixel**. The device pixel ratio on my phone is 3.875; [what's yours?](https://www.mydevice.io/)

The device pixel ratio on my desktop changes when I zoom in/out of the browser, but the default value is 1.5 (my `System > Display > Scale` is 150%).

Image files (except SVG) get decoded to a grid of pixels. **It's painfully hard to achieve a perfect ratio of image pixels to device pixels in a 1:1 relationship, but with `srcset`, you can get *close enough*. A little bit of JavaScript can resize the HTML element after load if you have really good reasons for needing a perfect matching. However, such forbidden techniques will not be divulged here.

> Other absolute [units (in, pc, pt, mm, cm, Q)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/length) are defined in terms of a number of CSS pixels and assume 96dpi. Developers avoid absolute units as it's generally better to use units derived from font size or viewport/container dimensions. Mismatched units can destroy layout when the user adjusts the `Settings > Accessibility > Text Size` multiplier, zooms the browser, or rotates the device. You should do all these things before releasing your website.
