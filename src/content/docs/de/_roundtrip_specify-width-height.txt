Why should you add width and height in your HTML?

> It is recommended to specify width and height attributes in HTML code for images because it helps the web browser to know the size of the image before it is fully loaded. This allows the browser to reserve the appropriate space on the webpage for the image, preventing content from jumping around while the image is being loaded.
>
> In addition, specifying the width and height attributes for images can help improve the overall performance of the webpage. When a browser knows the size of an image in advance, it can calculate the required space for displaying the image more accurately, avoiding unnecessary content reflows or repaints during loading.
>
> Overall, using width and height attributes in HTML code for images can improve the user experience by loading content faster and reducing visual disruptions.
