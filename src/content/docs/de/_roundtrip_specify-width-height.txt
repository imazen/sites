Why should you include width and height in HTML?

> It is recommended to include width and height attributes in the HTML code for images, as they help the web browser to know the size of the image before it is fully loaded. This allows the browser to reserve the appropriate space on the webpage for the image, which prevents content from jumping when the image is loaded.
> 
> Additionally, specifying width and height attributes for images can help improve the overall performance of the webpage. If a browser knows the size of an image in advance, it can more accurately calculate how much space is needed to display the image and avoid unnecessary reflows or repaints of the content during loading.
> 
> Overall, the use of width and height attributes in HTML code for images can improve the user experience by loading content faster and reducing visual errors.
