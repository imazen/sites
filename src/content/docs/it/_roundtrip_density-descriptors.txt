Srcset with density descriptors provides a simple and effective method to provide the most suitable image to the user's device, improving performance and user experience. This guide will walk you through the essentials of using srcset with density descriptors and provide markup examples for your convenience.
## What is Srcset with density descriptors?

Srcset is an HTML attribute designed to allow you to specify multiple image sources for a single `<img>` element. Density descriptors (`x`) are used alongside srcset to provide images at different resolutions based on the pixel density of the user's display.
## When to use Srcset with density descriptors

Using srcset with density descriptors is particularly useful when you want to:
1. Provide high-resolution images to high DPI displays (such as Retina displays) while providing lower resolution images to standard displays.
2. Improve page performance by providing the most appropriate images to each user's device.
## Implementing Srcset with density descriptors

To use srcset with density descriptors, follow these steps:
1. Prepare images in different resolutions.
2. Add the `srcset` attribute to the `<img>` element, including the image sources and corresponding density descriptors.
3. Add the `sizes` attribute (optional) to specify the image dimensions as it will be displayed on screen.
### Markup example

Here's an example of how to implement srcset with density descriptors in your markup:

```html
<img src="example-image-1x.jpg"
     srcset="example-image-1x.jpg 1x, example-image-2x.jpg 2x, example-image-3x.jpg 3x"
     alt="An example image">
```

This markup example includes:

- **src**: the default image source, displayed if the browser doesn't support srcset.
- **srcset**: the list of image sources and their corresponding density descriptors (1x, 2x, 3x). The browser will choose the most appropriate image based on the user's display.
- **alt**: an image description for accessibility purposes.

And that's it! You have successfully implemented srcset with density descriptors, improving your website's performance and user experience.
