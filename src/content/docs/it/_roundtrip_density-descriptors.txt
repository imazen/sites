Srcset with density descriptors provides a simple and effective method to deliver the most suitable image for each user's device, enhancing performance and user experience. This guide will walk you through the essentials of using srcset with density descriptors and provide markup examples for your convenience.
## What is Srcset with Density Descriptors?

Srcset is an HTML attribute designed to allow you to specify multiple image sources for a single `<img>` element. Density descriptors (`x`) are used in combination with srcset to provide images of different resolutions based on the pixel density of the user's display.
## When to Use Srcset with Density Descriptors

Using srcset with density descriptors is particularly useful when you want to:
1. Provide high-resolution images to high DPI displays (e.g., Retina displays) while providing lower resolution images to standard displays.
2. Improve page performance by providing the most appropriate image size for each user's device.
## How to Implement Srcset with Density Descriptors

To use srcset with density descriptors, follow these steps:
1. Prepare your images in different resolutions.
2. Add the `srcset` attribute to the `<img>` element, including the image sources and their respective density descriptors.
3. Add the `sizes` attribute (optional) to specify how the image size will be displayed on the screen.
### Markup Example

Here is an example of how to implement srcset with density descriptors in your markup:

```html
<img src="example-image-1x.jpg"
     srcset="example-image-1x.jpg 1x, example-image-2x.jpg 2x, example-image-3x.jpg 3x"
     alt="An example image">
```

This markup example includes: 
- **src**: The default image source, shown if the browser does not support srcset. 
- **srcset**: The list of image sources and their density descriptors (1x, 2x, 3x). The browser will select the most appropriate image based on the user's display.
- **alt**: A description of the image for accessibility purposes.

And that's it! You have successfully implemented srcset with density descriptors, enhancing your website's performance and user experience.
