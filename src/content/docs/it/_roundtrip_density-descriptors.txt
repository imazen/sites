Srcset with density descriptors provides a simple and effective method for providing users with the most suitable image for their device, improving performance and the user experience. This guide describes the essentials of using srcset with density descriptors and provides markup examples for your convenience.
## What is Srcset with Density Descriptors?

Srcset is an HTML attribute designed to allow for specifying multiple image sources for a single `<img>` element. Density descriptors (`x`) are used in conjunction with srcset to provide different resolution images based on the user's display pixel density.
## When to Use Srcset with Density Descriptors

Using srcset with density descriptors is particularly useful when you want to:
1. Serve high-resolution images to high-DPI displays (such as Retina displays) while also providing low-resolution images to standard displays.
2. Improve page performance by providing users with the most appropriate images for their device dimensions.
## Implementing Srcset with Density Descriptors

To use srcset with density descriptors, follow these steps:
1. Prepare your images in different resolutions.
2. Add the `srcset` attribute to the `<img>` element, including image sources and corresponding density descriptors.
3. Add the `sizes` attribute (optional) to specify image dimensions as it will be displayed on screen.
### Markup Example

Here's an example of how to implement srcset with density descriptors in your markup:

```html
<img src="example-image-1x.jpg"
     srcset="example-image-1x.jpg 1x, example-image-2x.jpg 2x, example-image-3x.jpg 3x"
     alt="An example image">
```

This markup example includes:
- **src**: The default image source shown if the browser doesn't support srcset.
- **srcset**: The list of image sources and its corresponding density descriptors (1x, 2x, 3x). The browser will choose the most appropriate image based on the user's display.
- **alt**: A description of the image for accessibility purposes.

And that's it! You have successfully implemented srcset with density descriptors, improving your website's performance and user experience.
