Why should you include width and height in HTML?

> It is recommended to include width and height attributes in the HTML code of images because it helps the web browser to know the dimensions of the image before it is fully loaded. This allows the browser to reserve the appropriate amount of space on the webpage for the image, avoiding content jumping while the image is loading.
> 
> Additionally, specifying width and height attributes for images can also contribute to improving the overall performance of the webpage. When a browser knows the dimensions of an image in advance, it can more accurately calculate the amount of space needed to display the image, avoiding unnecessary reorganizations or repaints of content while it is loading.
> 
> Ultimately, using width and height attributes in the HTML code of images can improve the user experience by making content load faster and reducing visual flicker.
