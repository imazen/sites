Why should you include width and height in your HTML code?

> It is recommended to include width and height attributes in HTML code for images because it helps the web browser to know the dimensions of the image before it is fully loaded. This allows the browser to reserve the appropriate amount of space on the webpage for the image, preventing content from bouncing around while the image is loading.
> 
> Additionally, specifying the width and height attributes for images can also contribute to overall webpage performance. When a browser knows the dimensions of an image beforehand, it can more accurately calculate the amount of space required to display it and avoid unnecessary or heavy content recalculations or repaints during loading.
> 
> In general, using width and height attributes in HTML code for images can improve the user experience by making the content faster to load and reducing visual errors.
