Why should you include width and height in HTML code?

> It is recommended to include width and height attributes in HTML code for images as this helps the web browser to know the dimensions of the image before it is fully loaded. This allows the browser to reserve the appropriate amount of space on the web page for the image, preventing content from jumping around while the image is loading.
> 
> Additionally, specifying width and height attributes for images can also help improve overall page performance. When a browser knows the dimensions of an image in advance, it can more accurately calculate the amount of space needed to display the image and avoid unnecessary recalculations or redraws of content during loading.
> 
> Generally, using width and height attributes in HTML code for images can improve the user experience by making the loading of content faster and reducing visual glitches.
