Why should you include width and height in HTML code?

> It is recommended to include width and height attributes in HTML code for images because it helps the web browser to know the dimensions of the image before it is fully loaded. This allows the browser to reserve the appropriate amount of space on the web page for the image, thus avoiding content jumping during image loading.
> 
> Additionally, specifying width and height attributes for images can also help improve overall web page performance. When a browser knows in advance the dimensions of an image, it can more accurately calculate the amount of space needed to display the image and avoid unnecessary recalculations or redraws of content during loading.
> 
> In general, using width and height attributes in HTML code for images can improve the user experience by making content faster to load and reducing visual discrepancies.
