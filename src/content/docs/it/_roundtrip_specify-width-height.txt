Why should you insert width and height in HTML?

> It is recommended to insert the width and height attributes in HTML code for images because it helps the web browser know the size of the image before it is fully loaded. This allows the browser to reserve the appropriate amount of space on the web page for the image, thereby preventing content from shifting as the image loads.
> 
> Additionally, specifying the width and height attributes for images can also contribute to improving the overall performance of the web page. When a browser knows the size of an image in advance, it can more accurately calculate the amount of space needed to display the image and avoid unnecessary reflows or repaints of content during loading.
> 
> In general, using the width and height attributes in HTML code for images can enhance the user experience by enabling faster content loading and reducing visual disturbances.
