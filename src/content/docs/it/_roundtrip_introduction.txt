**An efficient and decisive guide to images for 2023**

Check the sidebar for a deeper dive. This is the quick guide to updating `<img>` tags to handle modern devices in all their various sizes and pixel densities. You should know that pixels are not equal and that `devicePixelRatio` is more likely to be around 3.875 than 1:1. Modern phones pretend to have a width between 320 and 428px for legibility.

> If your image never changes size, no matter how much you resize the browser window, you should instead use a [density descriptor](/en/density-descriptors). This is often suitable for logos, icons, and buttons.

Do you know your [breakpoints](/en/breakpoints)? You'll need these numbers to refine the solution below, and at least the breakpoint of the viewport width at which the main content area stops growing.

### The easy method

```html
<img src="img.jpg?w=480" 
        srcset="img.jpg?format=webp&amp;w=480 480w, 
                img.jpg?format=webp&amp;w=800 800w, 
                img.jpg?format=webp&amp;w=1200 1200w, 
                img.jpg?format=webp&amp;w=1600 1600w, 
                img.jpg?format=webp&amp;w=2000 2000w"
        sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 800px" alt="Dog riding a bicycle" />

<!-- We have assumed that you have a breakpoint at 700px. 
     And that below that viewport width, this image should occupy 100% of the width, but
     when the viewport width is larger, the image is constrained to 800 CSS pixels -->

<!-- This assumption holds true even if you are using an RIAPI-compatible image server like Imageflow. 
     On-the-fly production of image variants is essential for developer sanity. -->
```
