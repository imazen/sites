**An Efficient and Opinionated Guide to Images for 2023**

Check the sidebar for an in-depth analysis. This is a quick overview for updating `<img>` tags to accommodate modern devices of varying sizes and pixel densities. You need to [know that pixels aren't equal](/en/pixels-not-pixels) and that `devicePixelRatio` tends to be around 3.875 rather than 1:1. Modern phones pretend to be 320-428px wide for readability (in CSS pixels), but have many device pixels per CSS pixel.

> If your image never changes size no matter how narrow the browser window is, you should use a [density descriptor](/en/density-descriptors). This is often appropriate for logos, icons, and buttons.

Do you know what your [breakpoints](/en/breakpoints) are? You'll need those numbers to refine the solution below - at least the viewport width breakpoint where the primary content area stops growing.

### The Easy Way

```html

<img src="img.jpg?w=480" 
        srcset="img.jpg?format=webp&w=480 480w, 
                img.jpg?format=webp&w=800 800w, 
                img.jpg?format=webp&w=1200 1200w, 
                img.jpg?format=webp&w=1600 1600w, 
                img.jpg?format=webp&w=2000 2000w"

        sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 800px" alt="Dog riding a bicycle" /> 

<!-- We assume you have a breakpoint at 700px. 
      And that below that viewport width, this image takes up 100% width, but 
      when the viewport is bigger, the image is constrained to 800 CSS pixels -->

<!-- This assumes you're using an RIAPI compatible image server like Imageflow. 
     Producing image variants on the fly is essential for developer sanity. -->
```
