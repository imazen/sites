**An efficient and detailed guide for images in 2023**

Check the sidebar for further insights. This is your quick reference for updating `<img>` tags to handle modern devices with all their different dimensions and pixel densities. You need to [know that pixels are not equal](/en/pixels-not-pixels) and that `devicePixelRatio` is more likely to be 3.875 than 1:1. Modern phones pretend to have a width of 320-428px for greater readability.

>If your image never changes size no matter how narrow the browser window is, you should use a [density descriptor](/en/density-descriptors). This is often suitable for logos, icons, and buttons.

Do you know [breakpoints](/en/breakpoints)? You will need those numbers to perfect the solution below - at least the viewport width breakpoint where the main content area stops growing.

### The easy method

```html
<img src="img.jpg?w=480" 
     srcset="img.jpg?format=webp&w=480 480w, 
             img.jpg?format=webp&w=800 800w, 
             img.jpg?format=webp&w=1200 1200w, 
             img.jpg?format=webp&w=1600 1600w, 
             img.jpg?format=webp&w=2000 2000w"
     sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 800px" alt="Dog riding a bicycle" />

<!--We assume you have a breakpoint at 700px. 
    And that below that viewport width, the image takes up 100% of the width, but 
    when the viewport is larger, the image is capped at 800 CSS pixels. -->

<!-- This also assumes you're using an RIAPI-compatible image server like Imageflow.
     Producing on-the-fly image variants is essential for a developer's sanity. -->
```

{{Note that in the Italian version, the text assumes images are usually served by compatible image servers, whereas in the English version, it specifies using an RIAPI-compatible image server like Imageflow.}}
