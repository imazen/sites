**An efficient and opinionated guide to images for 2023**

Check the sidebar for an in-depth guide. This is the summary for updating `<img>` tags to handle modern devices in their various sizes and pixel densities. You should know that pixels != pixels and that `devicePixelRatio` is more likely to be around 3.875 than 1:1. Modern phones pretend to be 320-428px wide for readability (in CSS pixels) but have many device pixels per CSS pixel.

> If your image never changes size, no matter how much you shrink the browser window, you should use a [density descriptor](/en/density-descriptors). This is often suitable for logos, icons, and buttons.

Do you know your [breakpoints](/en/breakpoints)? You'll need those numbers to fine-tune the solution below, and at least the breakpoint of the viewport width where the main content area stops growing.

### The easy way

```html
<img src="img.jpg?w=480" 
    srcset="img.jpg?format=webp&amp;w=480 480w, 
            img.jpg?format=webp&amp;w=800 800w, 
            img.jpg?format=webp&amp;w=1200 1200w, 
            img.jpg?format=webp&amp;w=1600 1600w, 
            img.jpg?format=webp&amp;w=2000 2000w"
    sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 800px" alt="Dog riding a bike" />

<!-- We've assumed you have a breakpoint at 700px. 
      And that below that viewport width, this image takes up 100% of the width, but 
      when the viewport is larger, the image is restricted to 800 CSS pixels. -->

<!-- This assumes that you're using a RIAPI-compliant image server like Imageflow. 
     Generating image variants on the fly is essential for programmer health. -->
```
