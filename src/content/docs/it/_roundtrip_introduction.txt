**An efficient and opinionated guide to images for 2023**

Check the sidebar for deeper insights. This is the quick guide to updating those `<img>` tags to handle modern devices in all their various sizes and pixel densities. You should [know that pixels != pixels](/en/pixels-not-pixels) and `devicePixelRatio` is more likely to be around 3.875 rather than 1:1. Modern phones pretend to be 320-428px wide for readability (in CSS pixels), but they have many device pixels for each CSS pixel.

> If your image never changes size, no matter how much you resize the browser window, you should use a [density descriptor instead](/en/density-descriptors). This is often suitable for logos, icons, and buttons.

Do you know what your [breakpoints](/en/breakpoints) are? You'll need those numbers to fine-tune the solution below - at a minimum the viewport width breakpoint where the main content area stops growing.

### The easy method

```html

<img src="img.jpg?w=480" 
        srcset="img.jpg?format=webp&w=480 480w, 
                img.jpg?format=webp&w=800 800w, 
                img.jpg?format=webp&w=1200 1200w, 
                img.jpg?format=webp&w=1600 1600w, 
                img.jpg?format=webp&w=2000 2000w"

        sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 800px" alt="Dog riding a bicycle" />

<!-- Assume you have a breakpoint at 700px. 
      And that below that viewport width, this image takes 100% of the width, but
      when the viewport is larger, the image is constrained to 800 CSS pixels -->

<!-- It's assumed you are using an image server compliant with RIAPI like Imageflow. 
     Producing image variants on the fly is essential for developers' sanity. -->
```
