**An efficient opinionated guide to images for 2023**

Check out the sidebar for a detailed explanation. This is a quick guide to updating those `<img>` tags to handle modern devices with all their varying sizes and pixel densities. You should [know that pixels â‰  pixels](/en/pixels-are-not-pixels) and `devicePixelRatio` is more likely to be around 3.875 than 1:1. Modern phones pretend to be wide from 320-428px for legibility (in CSS pixels), but have many device pixels per CSS pixel.

> If your image never changes in size no matter how much you shrink the browser window, you should use a [density descriptor](/en/density-descriptors). This is often suitable for logos, icons, and buttons.

Do you know what your [breakpoints](/en/breakpoints) are? You'll need those numbers to fine-tune the solution below - and at least the viewport width breakpoint where the main content area stops growing.

### The simplest method

```html

<img src="img.jpg?w=480" 
        srcset="img.jpg?format=webp&w=480 480w, 
                img.jpg?format=webp&w=800 800w, 
                img.jpg?format=webp&w=1200 1200w, 
                img.jpg?format=webp&w=1600 1600w, 
                img.jpg?format=webp&w=2000 2000w"
        sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 800px" alt="Dog riding a bicycle" />

<!-- We're assuming you have a breakpoint at 700px. 
      And that below that viewport width, this image takes up 100% of the width, but 
      when the viewport is larger, the image is limited to 800 CSS pixels wide -->

<!-- You're assumed to be using a RIAPI-compatible image server like Imageflow. 
     Producing on-the-fly image variants is essential for developer sanity. -->
