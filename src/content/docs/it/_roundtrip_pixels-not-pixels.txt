### Device pixels ≠ browser pixels ≠ image pixels

Thanks to Apple, CSS and HTML pixels (`px`) **almost always correspond to more device/printer pixels**. My phone's devicePixelRatio is 3.875; [what's yours?](https://www.mydevice.io/)

My desktop's devicePixelRatio changes with the browser zoom, but it's 1.5 by default (my `System > Display > Scale` is set to 150%, after all).

Image files (excluding SVGs) decode a grid of pixels. **It's annoyingly difficult to display image pixels perfectly 1:1 with device pixels, but with the `srcset` attribute, you can come close enough**, and some JavaScript can adjust the size of the HTML element after loading if you have a really good reason to need that perfect correspondence, although such forbidden tricks won't be revealed here.

> Other absolute units [in, pc, pt, mm, cm, Q](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/length) are defined based on the number of CSS pixels and pretend that everything is at 96dpi. Developers avoid absolute units because it's generally better to use units that are derived from font or viewport/container sizes. Discordant units can break a layout if the user adjusts their `Accessibility > Text Size` multiplier, enlarges the browser, or rotates the device. Needless to say, you should do all these things before publishing your site.
