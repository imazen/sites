### Device pixels ≠ browser pixels ≠ image pixels

Thanks to Apple, CSS and HTML pixels (`px`) **almost always correspond to more device/printer pixels**. My phone's devicePixelRatio is 3.875; [what's yours?](https://www.mydevice.io/)

My desktop's devicePixelRatio changes with the browser zoom, but by default it is 1.5 (my `System > Display > Scale` is at 150%, after all).

Image files (excluding SVGs) decode to a grid of pixels. **Getting the image pixels to display at a perfect 1:1 ratio with device pixels is annoyingly difficult, but with the `srcset` attribute you can get close enough**, and some JavaScript can adjust the HTML element size after load if you have a really justified reason for needing that perfect match, though such dark arts will not be revealed here.

> Other absolute units [in, pc, pt, mm, cm, Q](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/CSS/length) are defined in relation to the number of CSS pixels and pretend everything is at 96dpi. Developers avoid absolute units because it's usually better to use units that derive from character or viewport/container dimensions. Dissimilar units can break a layout if the user adjusts their `Accessibility > Text Size` multiplier, zooms the browser or rotates the device. Needless to say, you should do all these things before publishing your site.
