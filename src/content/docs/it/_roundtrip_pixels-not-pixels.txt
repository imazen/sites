### Device pixels ≠ browser px ≠ image px

Thanks to Apple, CSS and HTML pixels (`px`) **almost always correspond to device/printer pixels**. My phone's `devicePixelRatio` is 3.875; [what's yours?](https://www.mydevice.io/)

My desktop's `devicePixelRatio` changes with the browser's zoom, but it's 1.5 by default (since my `System > Display > Zoom` is at 150%).

Image files (excluding SVGs) are decoded into a grid of pixels. **It's annoyingly difficult to get image pixels to display perfectly 1:1 with device pixels, but with `srcset` you can get *close enough***, and some JavaScript can adjust HTML element sizes after loading if you have good reason to get a perfect mapping, though these dark arts won't be revealed here.

> Other absolute units [in, pc, pt, mm, cm, Q](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/length) are defined in terms of CSS pixels and pretend everything is 96dpi. Devs avoid absolute units because it's generally better to use units derived from font size or viewport/container dimensions. Inconsistent units can break a layout if the user adjusts the `Accessibility > Text Size` multiplier, zooms the browser, or rotates the device. Of course, you should do all these things before publishing your site.
