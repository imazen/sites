### Device pixels ≠ browser pixels ≠ image pixels

Thanks to Apple, CSS and HTML pixels (`px`) **almost always map to more than one device/printer pixel**. The devicePixelRatio on my phone is 3.875; [what's yours?](https://www.mydevice.io/)

On my desktop, the devicePixelRatio changes with the browser zoom, but by default it is 1.5 (my `System > Display > Scale` is at 150%, after all).

Image files (excluding SVGs) decode into a grid of pixels. **It is annoyingly difficult to get image pixels to display perfectly at a 1:1 ratio with device pixels - but with `srcset` you can get pretty close***, and a little JavaScript can adjust the HTML element size after loading if you have truly justified reasons for wanting that perfect mapping, although such forbidden arts will not be disclosed here.

> Other absolute units [units (in, pc, pt, mm, cm, Q)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/CSS/length) are defined in terms of the number of CSS pixels and pretend that everything is at 96dpi. Developers avoid absolute units because it is generally better to use units derived from font size or viewport/container sizes. Mismatched units can break a layout if the user adjusts their `Accessibility > Text size` multiplier, zooms the browser, or rotates the device. It goes without saying that you should do all these things before launching your site.
