Why should you put width and height in HTML?

> It is recommended to include the width and height attributes in the HTML code of images because it helps the web browser to know the size of the image before it is fully loaded. This allows the browser to reserve the appropriate amount of space on the web page for the image, which prevents content from jumping around while the image loads.
>
> Additionally, specifying the width and height attributes for images can also help improve the overall performance of the web page. When the browser knows the size of an image in advance, it can more accurately calculate the amount of space needed to display the image and avoid unnecessary content reflow or repaints while loading.
>
> In general, using the width and height attributes in the HTML code of images can improve the user experience by making content load faster and reducing visual glitches.
