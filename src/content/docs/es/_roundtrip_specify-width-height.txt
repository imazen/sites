Why should you include width and height in HTML?

> It is recommended to use width and height attributes in HTML code for images because it helps the web browser to know the size of the image before it is fully loaded. This allows the browser to reserve the appropriate amount of space on the web page for the image, preventing content from jumping while the image loads.
> 
> Furthermore, specifying width and height attributes for images can also help improve the overall performance of the web page. When a browser knows the size of an image in advance, it can more accurately calculate the amount of space needed to display the image and avoid unnecessary reflows or repaints of the content while it loads.
> 
> In general, using width and height attributes in HTML code for images can enhance the user experience by making the content load faster and reducing visual glitches.
