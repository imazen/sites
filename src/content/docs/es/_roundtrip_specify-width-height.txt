Why should you use width and height in HTML?

> It's recommended to use width and height attributes in HTML code for images because it helps the web browser know the size of the image before it fully loads. This allows the browser to reserve the appropriate amount of space on the webpage for the image, which prevents content from jumping around while the image loads.
>
> Additionally, specifying the width and height attributes for images can also help improve overall webpage performance. When a browser knows the size of an image in advance, it can more accurately calculate the amount of space needed to display the image and prevent unnecessary reflows or repaints of content as it loads.
>
> Overall, using width and height attributes in HTML code for images can improve the user experience by making content load faster and reducing visual glitches.
