Understanding width (w) and density (x) descriptors in `srcset`. Use examples and Markdown.

> `srcset` is an HTML attribute that allows developers to provide multiple image sources with different resolutions or pixel densities, and let the browser select the appropriate image based on the characteristics of the device's screen. The `srcset` attribute uses a combination of the `URL` and the `w` or `x` descriptors to specify the images.
## Width Descriptors (`w`)

> The `w` descriptor is used to specify the width of an image in pixels. It is used when we want to provide the browser with the dimensions of an image so that it can choose the appropriate image for the available screen space.

> The syntax for using the `w` descriptor in `srcset` is as follows:

```html
<img src="small.jpg"
  srcset="small.jpg 500w,
          medium.jpg 1000w,
          large.jpg 2000w"
  alt="Example Image">
```



> In the above example, we have provided the browser with three images and their corresponding widths in pixels. The browser will select the image with the width closest to the available screen space.
## Density Descriptors (`x`)

> The `x` descriptor is used to specify the pixel density of an image, which is the ratio of physical pixels to CSS pixels. It is used when we want to provide the browser with different versions of the same image with different pixel densities.

> The syntax for using the `x` descriptor in `srcset` is as follows:

```html
<img src="small.jpg"
  srcset="small.jpg 1x,
          medium.jpg 2x,
          large.jpg 3x"
  alt="Example Image">
```


> In the above example, we have provided the browser with three images and their corresponding pixel densities. The browser will select the image with the pixel density closest to the device's screen.

> Note that the `w` and `x` descriptors can be used together in the same `srcset` attribute to provide the browser with more options to choose from.
