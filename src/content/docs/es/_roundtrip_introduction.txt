**An efficient and forward-looking guide to images in 2023**

Check the sidebar for a deeper explanation. This is the quick reference for updating `<img>` tags and handling modern devices in all their various resolutions and pixel densities. You should [know that pixels != pixels](/en/pixels-not-pixels) and that `devicePixelRatio` is more likely to be 3.875 than 1:1. Modern phones simulate having a width of 320 to 428 pixels for improved legibility (in CSS pixels), but have many device pixels per CSS pixel.

> If your image never changes size, no matter how narrow the browser window, you should use a [corresponding density descriptor](/en/density-descriptors). This is usually suitable for logos, icons, and buttons.

Do you know your [breakpoints](/en/breakpoints)? You'll need those numbers to fine-tune the solution below and at a minimum, the breakpoint for the viewport width where the main content area stops growing.

### The Easy Way

```html
<img
  src="img.jpg?w=480"
  srcset="
    img.jpg?format=webp&w=480 480w, 
    img.jpg?format=webp&w=800 800w, 
    img.jpg?format=webp&w=1200 1200w, 
    img.jpg?format=webp&w=1600 1600w, 
    img.jpg?format=webp&w=2000 2000w
  "
  sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 800px"
  alt="Dog on a bike"
/>

<!-- We've assumed you have a breakpoint at 700px. 
      And that below that frame width, this image takes up 100% width, but
      when the frame gets wider the image is limited to 800 CSS pixels wide -->

<!-- This assumes you're using an image server that supports RIAPI, such as Imageflow.
      On-the-fly image variant production is essential for developer sanity. -->
```

{{Note that "RIAPI" appears to be a mistype and should be corrected to "RIAPI". }}
