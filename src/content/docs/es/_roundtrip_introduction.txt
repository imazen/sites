**An efficient guide with opinions on responsive images for 2023**

See the sidebar for a detailed explanation. This is a quick reference to improve those `<img>` tags and allow for handling modern devices with their varied sizes and pixel densities. You should know that pixels are not always equal to each other [«pixels != pixels»](/en/pixels-not-pixels) and that a `devicePixelRatio` is more likely to be 3.875 instead of 1:1. Modern phones behave as if their width is between 320 and 428 px for legibility.

> If your image never changes size no matter how narrow the browser window, you should use a [density descriptor instead](/en/density-descriptors). This is usually suitable for logos, icons and buttons.

Do you know your [breakpoints](/en/breakpoints)? You'll need those numbers to fine tune the solution below -- and at minimum, the breakpoint at which the graphics window width stops growing for the main content area.


### The Easy Method

```html
<img src="img.jpg?w=480"
     srcset="img.jpg?format=webp&w=480 480w,
             img.jpg?format=webp&w=800 800w, 
             img.jpg?format=webp&w=1200 1200w, 
             img.jpg?format=webp&w=1600 1600w, 
             img.jpg?format=webp&w=2000 2000w"
     sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 800px" alt="Dog riding bike" />

<!-- We've assumed you have a breakpoint at 700px. 
     And that before that window width, the image takes up 100% of the width, but
     when the window is larger, the image is limited to 800 CSS pixels. -->

<!-- We also assume you're using an RIAPI-compatible image server, like Imageflow. Producing on-the-fly image variants is essential for developer sanity. -->
```
