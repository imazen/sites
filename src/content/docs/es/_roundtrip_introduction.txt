**An Efficient and Thoughtful Guide to Responsive Images for 2023**

Check the sidebar for a deep dive. This is the quick reference for updating those `<img>` tags and handling modern devices in all their different sizes and pixel densities. You should [know that not all pixels are created equal](/en/pixels-not-pixels) and that `devicePixelRatio` is more likely to be around 3.875 than 1:1. Modern phones pretend to be between 320-428px wide for better reading.

> If your image is never going to change size, no matter how narrow the browser window gets, you should use a [pixel density descriptor instead](/en/density-descriptors). This is often suitable for logos, icons, and buttons.

Do you know your [breakpoints](/en/breakpoints)? You'll need those numbers to adjust the solution below, and at minimum, the breakpoint of the main content area width where it stops growing.


### The Easy Way

```html

<img src="img.jpg?w=480"
     srcset="img.jpg?format=webp&amp;w=480 480w,
             img.jpg?format=webp&amp;w=800 800w,
             img.jpg?format=webp&amp;w=1200 1200w,
             img.jpg?format=webp&amp;w=1600 1600w,
             img.jpg?format=webp&amp;w=2000 2000w"
     sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 800px"
     alt="Dog riding a bicycle">

<!-- We have assumed that you have a breakpoint at 700px.
      And that below that viewport width, this image takes up 100% of the width, while
      when the viewport is larger, the image is capped at 800 CSS pixels wide -->

<!-- This also assumes that you are using a RIAP-compatible image server like Imageflow.
     On-demand image variant production is essential to developer sanity. -->
