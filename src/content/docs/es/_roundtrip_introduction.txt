**An efficient and opinionated guide to images for 2023**

See the sidebar for detailed information. This is the quick reference for updating your `<img>` tags and handling modern devices in all their different sizes and pixel densities. You should [know that pixels aren't equal](/en/pixels-not-pixels) and `devicePixelRatio` is more likely to be around 3.875 than 1:1. Modern phones pretend to be 320-428 pixels wide for legibility (in CSS pixels), but have many device pixels per CSS pixel.

> If your image never changes size no matter how narrow the browser window, you should use a [density descriptor](/en/density-descriptors). This is often suitable for logos, icons, and buttons.

Do you know your [breakpoints](/en/breakpoints)? You'll need those numbers to adjust the solution below — at minimum, the viewport width breakpoint where the main content area stops growing.

### The easy method

```html

<img src="img.jpg?w=480" 
        srcset="img.jpg?format=webp&w=480 480w, 
                img.jpg?format=webp&w=800 800w, 
                img.jpg?format=webp&w=1200 1200w, 
                img.jpg?format=webp&w=1600 1600w, 
                img.jpg?format=webp&w=2000 2000w"

        sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 800px" alt="Dog riding a bicycle" />

<!-- We assume you have a breakpoint at 700px. 
     And that at that viewport width, this image takes up 100% of the width, but 
     when the viewport is wider, the image is limited to 800 CSS pixels -->

<!-- This assumes that you're using an image serving technology that supports RIAPI, such as Imageflow. 
     Generating image variants on the fly is essential for developer sanity. -->
```
