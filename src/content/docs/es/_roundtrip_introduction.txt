**An Efficient and Opinionated Guide to Images for 2023**

See the sidebar for an in-depth analysis. This is a quick reference for updating those `<img>` tags to handle modern devices at all their sizes and pixel densities. You should [understand that pixels != pixels](/en/pixels-not-pixels) and that `devicePixelRatio` is more likely to be around 3.875 rather than 1:1. Modern phones aim to have a width of 320 to 428px for better readability (in CSS pixels), but they have many device pixels per CSS pixel.

> If your image never changes size, no matter how narrow the browser window, you should use a [density descriptor instead](/en/density-descriptors). This is typically appropriate for logos, icons, and buttons.

Do you know your [breakpoints](/en/breakpoints)? You'll need those numbers to adjust the solution below, and at minimum the breakpoint for the width of the viewport where the main content area stops growing.

### The Simple Method

```html
<img src="img.jpg?w=480" 
     srcset="img.jpg?format=webp&amp;w=480 480w, 
             img.jpg?format=webp&amp;w=800 800w, 
             img.jpg?format=webp&amp;w=1200 1200w, 
             img.jpg?format=webp&amp;w=1600 1600w, 
             img.jpg?format=webp&amp;w=2000 2000w"
     sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 800px" alt="Dog riding a bicycle" />
     
<!-- We've assumed you have a breakpoint at 700px. 
And that under that viewport width, this image takes up 100% of the width, but 
when the viewport is larger, the image is capped at 800 CSS pixels. -->

<!-- This assumes you're using an RIAPI-compatible image server, such as Imageflow. 
On-the-fly production of image variants is essential for developer sanity. -->
```
