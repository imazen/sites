**An Efficient and Opinionated Guide on Images for 2023**

Check the sidebar for an in-depth analysis. This is a quick reference to update those `<img>` tags and handle modern devices in all their various sizes and pixel densities. You should [know that pixels != pixels](/en/pixels-not-pixels) and `devicePixelRatio` is more likely to be around 3.875 than 1:1. Modern phones pretend to have a width of 320-428px for readability (in CSS pixels), but have many device pixels per CSS pixel.

> If your image never resizes, no matter how narrow you make the browser window, you should use a [density descriptor instead](/en/density-descriptors). This is often suitable for logos, icons, and buttons.

Do you know your [breakpoints](/en/breakpoints)? You will need these numbers to fine-tune the solution below - at a minimum, the viewport width breakpoint where the main content area stops growing.


### The easy method

```html

<img src = "img.jpg?w=480" 
        srcset="img.jpg?format=webp&w=480 480w, 
                img.jpg?format=webp&w=800 800w, 
                img.jpg?format=webp&w=1200 1200w, 
                img.jpg?format=webp&w=1600 1600w, 
                img.jpg?format=webp&w=2000 2000w"

        sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 800px" alt="Dog riding a bicycle" />

<!-- We have assumed you have a breakpoint at 700px. 
      And that below that viewport width, this image occupies 100% of the width, but
      when the viewport is larger, the image is limited to 800 CSS pixels -->

<!-- This assumes you are using an RIAPI-compatible image server like Imageflow. 
     Generating image variants on the fly is essential for developer sanity. -->
```
