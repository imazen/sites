Provide several examples of using the `<picture>` element and succinctly explain each one.

Here are some examples of using the `<picture>` element and their explanations:

1. Example for responsive images:

```html
<picture>
  <source srcset="large-image.jpg" media="(min-width: 768px)" />
  <source srcset="medium-image.jpg" media="(min-width: 480px)" />
  <img src="small-image.jpg" alt="An image" />
</picture>
```

Explanation: In this example, the `<picture>` element is used to provide different image sources for different screen sizes. The `<source>` elements specify the different image sources using the "srcset" attribute and the "media" attribute to specify the conditions under which each source should be used. The `<img>` element is used as a fallback for older browsers or when the conditions specified in the `<source>` elements are not met.

2. Example for art direction:

```html
<picture>
  <source srcset="wide-image.jpg" media="(orientation: landscape)" />

  <img src="vertical-image.jpg" alt="An image" />
</picture>
```

Explanation: In this example, the `<picture>` element is used to provide different image sources based on the orientation of the device. The `<source>` element with the "media" attribute set to "(orientation: landscape)" specifies an image source for wide screens, while the `<img>` element specifies an image source for vertical screens.

3. Example for different image formats:

```html
<picture>
  <source srcset="image.webp" type="image/webp" />

  <source srcset="image.png" type="image/png" />

  <img src="image.jpg" alt="An image" />
</picture>
```

Explanation: In this example, the `<picture>` element is used to provide different image sources for different image formats. The `<source>` elements specify different image sources using the "srcset" attribute and the "type" attribute to specify the image format. The `<img>` element is used as a fallback for older browsers that do not support the `<picture>` element.
