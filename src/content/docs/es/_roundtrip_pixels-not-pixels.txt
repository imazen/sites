### Device Pixels ≠ Browser Pixels ≠ Image Pixels

Thanks to Apple, CSS and HTML pixels (`px`) **almost always map to multiple device/printer pixels**. My phone's devicePixelRatio is 3.875; [what's yours?](https://www.mydevice.io/)

My desktop devicePixelRatio changes with the browser zoom, but is set to 1.5 by default (after all, my `System > Display > Scale` is set to 150%).

Image files (excluding SVG) decode to a grid of pixels. **It's annoyingly difficult to get the image pixels to display perfectly at a 1:1 ratio with device pixels—but with `srcset` you can get close enough**, and a bit of Javascript can adjust the size of the HTML element after loading if you really have a justified reason for needing that perfect mapping, though such forbidden arts won't be revealed here.

> Other absolute units [units (in, pc, pt, mm, cm, Q)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/CSS/length) are defined in terms of the CSS pixel count and presume 96ppi. Developers avoid absolute units because it's generally better to use units derived from font size or viewport/container dimensions. Incompatible units can break layout if the user adjusts the `Accessibility > Text size multiplier`, zooms the browser, or rotates their device. It should be noted that you should do all these things before launching your site.
