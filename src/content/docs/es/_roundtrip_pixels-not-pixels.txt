### Device pixels ≠ browser pixels ≠ image pixels

Thanks to Apple, CSS and HTML pixels (`px`) are **almost always mapped to multiple device/printer pixels**. My phone's devicePixelRatio is 3.875; [what's yours?](https://www.mydevice.io/)

My desktop devicePixelRatio changes with my browser zoom, but by default it's 1.5 (after all, my `System > Display > Scale` is 150%).

Image files (excluding SVGs) are decoded to a grid of pixels. **Getting the image pixels to display perfectly 1:1 with device pixels is excruciatingly difficult, but with `srcset`, you can get *close enough***, and a little JavaScript can adjust the size of the HTML element after load if you have a really good reason for needing that perfect mapping, though such dark arts won't be revealed here.

> Other absolute units [in, pc, pt, mm, cm, Q](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/CSS/length) are defined in terms of a number of CSS pixels and pretend everything is at 96 dpi. Developers avoid absolute units because it's generally better to use units derived from font size or viewport/container dimensions. Mismatched units can break a layout if the user adjusts their `Accessibility > Text size` multiplier, zooms in the browser, or rotates their device. Needless to say, you should do all these things before launching your site.
