### Device pixels ≠ browser pixels ≠ image pixels

Thanks to Apple, CSS and HTML pixels (`px`) **almost always map to multiple device/printer pixels**. The devicePixelRatio on my phone is 3.875; [what's yours?](https://www.mydevice.io/es/)

The devicePixelRatio of my desktop changes when I zoom in on the browser, but by default, it's 1.5 (my `System > Display > Scale` is 150%, after all).

Image files (excluding SVG) are decoded into a grid of pixels. **It is annoyingly difficult to make image pixels display perfectly at a 1:1 ratio with device pixels, but with `srcset` you can come quite close**, and a bit of JavaScript can adjust the size of the HTML element after loading if you have truly justified reasons to need that perfect mapping, although such forbidden arts will not be revealed here.

> Other [absolute units (in, pc, pt, mm, cm, Q)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/length) are defined in terms of the number of CSS pixels and pretend that everything is 96dpi. Developers avoid absolute units because it is generally better to use units derived from the font size or from the dimensions of the viewport/container. Mismatched units can break a layout if the user adjusts their `Accessibility > Text size` multiplier, zooms in the browser, or rotates their device. Needless to say, you should do all these things before launching your site.

{{Note that the section starting with "The devicePixelRatio of my desktop changes..." is a bit clumsy in its phrasing. It might be clearer to simply state: "On my desktop, the devicePixelRatio is 1.5 by default, though it changes when I zoom in on the browser."}}
