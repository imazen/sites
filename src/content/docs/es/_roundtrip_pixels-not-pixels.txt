### Device pixels ≠ browser pixels ≠ image pixels

Thanks to Apple, CSS and HTML pixels (`px`) are almost always assigned to multiple device/printer pixels. My phone's devicePixelRatio is 3.875; [what's yours?](https://www.mydevice.io/)

My desktop devicePixelRatio changes with the browser zoom, but it's 1.5 by default (after all, my `System > Display > Scale` is 150%).

Image files (excluding SVG) get decoded into a grid of pixels. **Getting image pixels to display perfectly at a 1:1 ratio with device pixels is annoyingly difficult, but with `srcset` you can get close enough, and a bit of JavaScript can adjust the size of the HTML element after loading if you really have a valid reason for that perfect mapping, though such dark arts will not be revealed here.**

> Other absolute units [units (in, pc, pt, mm, cm, Q)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/length) are defined in terms of the CSS pixel count and are supposed to be 96ppi. Developers avoid absolute units because it's generally best to use units derived from the font-size or viewport/container dimensions. Incompatible units can break layout if the user adjusts the `Accessibility > Text Size` multiplier, zooms in the browser, or rotates their device. It should be noted that you should do all of these things before launching your site.
