### Device Pixels are not the same as Browser Pixels or Image Pixels

Thanks to Apple, CSS and HTML pixels (`px`) **are almost always mapped to multiple device or printer pixels**. My phone's `devicePixelRatio` is 3.875; [what's yours?](https://www.mydevice.io/)

My desktop's `devicePixelRatio` changes when I zoom in the browser, but the default value is 1.5 (because my `System > Display > Scale` setting is 150%).

Image files (excluding SVGs) are decoded into a grid of pixels. **It's annoying to get image pixels to display at a perfect 1:1 ratio with device pixels, but with `srcset` you can get close enough**, and a bit of Javascript can adjust the HTML element size after the page loads if you have truly compelling reasons for needing that perfect mapping, but such forbidden arts will not be revealed here.

> The other absolute units [in, pc, pt, mm, cm, Q](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/length) are defined in terms of the number of CSS pixels and assume that everything is running at 96dpi. Developers avoid absolute units because it's generally better to use units that derive from font size or frame/container dimensions. Unequal units can break a layout if the user adjusts their `Accessibility > Text Size` multiplier, zooms in the browser or rotates their device. Actually, you should do all these things before launching your site.
