title: When to Use the <picture> Element
description: Explains in which situations you should use the <picture> element

---

The `picture` element is used to provide multiple versions of an image and determines which version of the image to display based on certain conditions. It is particularly useful for optimizing images for different screen sizes and resolutions, and is commonly used in responsive web design. Here are some specific scenarios where you might want to use the `picture` element:

* **Retina Screens:** High-density screens like Apple's Retina displays have a higher pixel density, meaning images can appear blurry or pixelated if they are not optimized for high resolution. With the `picture` element, you can provide a version of the image that has twice the pixels of the normal version, so it appears sharp and clear on Retina screens.

* **Different Aspect Ratios:** If you're designing a site that needs to display images with different aspect ratios (such as landscape vs. portrait), you can use the `picture` element to provide different versions of the image that are optimized for each aspect ratio.

* **Bandwidth Constraints:** Images can be large files that take up a lot of bandwidth, especially on mobile devices. With the `picture` element, you can provide smaller versions of the image for devices with smaller screens or slower internet connections, which can help reduce page loading times.

* **Art Directed Designs:** Sometimes you may want to present an image in a certain way depending on the design of the rest of the page. For example, you might want to show a close-up of a person's face on mobile devices, but a wider shot on desktop devices. The `picture` element allows you to provide different versions of the image that are optimized for different designs.

Overall, the `picture` element is a powerful tool that can help you optimize your images for a variety of use cases and ensure that they look great no matter what device or screen size they are viewed on.
