Why should you include width and height in HTML code?

> It is recommended to include the width and height attributes in HTML code for images because it helps the browser know the size of the image before it is fully loaded. This allows the browser to reserve the correct amount of space on the webpage for the image, which prevents content from jumping around as the image loads.
> 
> Additionally, specifying the width and height attributes for images can also help improve the overall performance of the webpage. When a browser knows the size of an image in advance, it can more accurately calculate the amount of space needed to display the image and avoid unnecessary relayouts or repaints of the content as it loads.
> 
> Using the width and height attributes in HTML code for images can improve the user experience by making content load faster and reducing visual errors.
