Why should you specify width and height in HTML?

> It is recommended to set the width and height attributes in the HTML code for images because it helps the browser to know the size of the image before it is fully loaded. This allows the browser to reserve the right amount of space on the webpage for the image, which prevents content from jumping around as the image loads.
>
> Additionally, specifying width and height attributes for images can also help improve the overall performance of the website. When a browser knows the size of an image in advance, it can more accurately calculate the amount of space needed to display the image and avoid unnecessary rearrangements or repaints of the content as it loads.
>
> Overall, using width and height attributes in the HTML code for images can improve user experience by making content load faster and reducing visual disruptions.
