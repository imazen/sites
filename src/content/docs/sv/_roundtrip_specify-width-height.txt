Why should you add width and height to your HTML code?

> It is recommended to add width and height attributes to images in HTML code because it helps the browser know the size of the image before it has fully loaded. This allows the browser to reserve appropriate space on the web page for the image, preventing content from jumping around when the image loads.
> 
> Additionally, specifying the width and height attributes for images can also help improve the performance of the web page as a whole. When a browser knows the size of an image in advance, it can more accurately calculate the amount of space needed to display the image and avoid unnecessary reloading or redrawing of content as it loads.
> 
> Overall, using width and height attributes in HTML code for images can improve user experience by making content load faster and reducing visual errors.
