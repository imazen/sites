Why should you set width and height in HTML code?

> It is recommended to set width and height attributes in HTML code for images because it helps the browser to know the size of the image before it's fully loaded. This allows the browser to reserve appropriate space on the web page for the image, which prevents content from jumping around while the image is loading.
> 
> Additionally, specifying width and height attributes for images can also contribute to improving the performance of the web page as a whole. When a browser knows the size of an image in advance, it can more accurately calculate the amount of space needed to display the image and avoid unnecessary recalculations or content reflows as it loads.
> 
> In summary, using width and height attributes in HTML code for images can improve the user experience by making content load faster and reducing visual inconsistencies.
