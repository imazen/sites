Understanding the `w` (width) and `x` (density) descriptors in `srcset`. Use examples and Markdown.

>`srcset` is an HTML attribute that allows developers to provide multiple image sources with different resolutions or pixel densities and let the browser choose the appropriate image based on the device's display characteristics. The `srcset` attribute uses a combination of `URL` and `w` or `x` descriptors to specify the images.

## Width (`w`) descriptors

>The `w` descriptor is used to specify the image width in pixels. It is used when we want to provide the browser with the image's dimensions so that it can choose the right image for the available screen space.

>The syntax for using the `w` descriptor in `srcset` is as follows:

```html
<img src="small.jpg"
  srcset="small.jpg 500w,
          medium.jpg 1000w,
          large.jpg 2000w"
  alt="Example image">
```

>In the example above, we have provided the browser with three images and their corresponding widths in pixels. The browser selects the image with the nearest width to the available screen space.

## Density (`x`) descriptors

>The `x` descriptor is used to specify the image pixel density, which is the ratio of physical pixels to CSS pixels. It is used when we want to provide the browser with different versions of the same image with different pixel densities.

>The syntax for using the `x` descriptor in `srcset` is as follows:

```html
<img src="small.jpg"
  srcset="small.jpg 1x,
          medium.jpg 2x,
          large.jpg 3x"
  alt="Example image">
```

>In the example above, we have provided the browser with three images and their corresponding pixel densities. The browser selects the image with the nearest pixel density to the device's screen.

>Note that both `w` and `x` descriptors can be used together in the same `srcset` attribute to provide the browser with more options to choose from.
