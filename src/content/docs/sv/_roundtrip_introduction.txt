**An efficient and definite guide to images for 2023**

Check the sidebar for a more in-depth description. This is the quick reference for upgrading `<img>` tags to handle modern devices in all their different sizes and pixel densities. You should know that pixels != pixels and `devicePixelRatio` is more likely to be around 3.875 than 1:1. Modern phones pretend to be 320-428px wide for legibility (in CSS-pixels), but have many device pixels per CSS-pixel.

>If your image never changes size no matter how narrow you make the browser window, you should use a density descriptor instead. This is often appropriate for logos, icons and buttons.

Do you know what your breakpoints are? You will need these numbers to fine-tune the solution below - and at a minimum the viewport width breakpoint where the main content area stops growing in width.

### The simple method

```html
<img src="img.jpg?w=480" 
     srcset="img.jpg?format=webp&w=480 480w, 
             img.jpg?format=webp&w=800 800w, 
             img.jpg?format=webp&w=1200 1200w, 
             img.jpg?format=webp&w=1600 1600w, 
             img.jpg?format=webp&w=2000 2000w"
             
     sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 800px" 
     alt="Dog riding a bike" />

<!-- We assume that you have a breakpoint at 700px. 
     And that below that viewport width, the image takes up 100% of the width, but 
     when the viewport is wider, the image is constrained to 800 CSS pixels -->

<!-- This assumes that you are using an RIAPI-compatible image server such as Imageflow. 
     On-demand image variant production is critical for developer health. -->
```
