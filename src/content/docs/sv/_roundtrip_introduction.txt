**An Effective and Comprehensive Guide to Images for 2023**

Check the sidebar for a deep dive. This is the quick reference for upgrading those `<img>` tags to handle modern devices in all their different sizes and pixel densities. You should [know that pixels != pixels](/en/pixels-not-pixels) and `devicePixelRatio` is more likely to be around 3.875 than 1:1. Modern phones pretend to be 320-428px wide for readability (in CSS pixels), but have many device pixels per CSS pixel.

> If your image never changes size, no matter how narrow you make the browser window, you should use a [density descriptor instead](/en/density-descriptors). This is often suitable for logos, icons, and buttons.

Do you know what your [breakpoints](/en/breakpoints) are? You need these numbers to finetune the solution below - and at least the width breakpoint for the viewport where the main content area stops growing.

### The Simple Method

```html

<img src="img.jpg?w=480" 
        srcset="img.jpg?format=webp&w=480 480w, 
                img.jpg?format=webp&w=800 800w, 
                img.jpg?format=webp&w=1200 1200w, 
                img.jpg?format=webp&w=1600 1600w, 
                img.jpg?format=webp&w=2000 2000w"

        sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 800px" alt="Dog cycling" />

<!-- We have assumed you have a breakpoint at 700px.
      And that below that viewport width, this image takes up 100% of the width, but
      when the viewport is larger, the image is limited to 800 CSS pixels -->

<!-- This assumes you are using a RIAPI-compatible image server like Imageflow.
     Production of image variants on-the-fly is crucial for developer peace of mind. -->
```

[List of Mistakes or Clumsy Phrasing]

1. {{The phrase "uppfattande guide" in Swedish might be more directly translated as "perceptive guide," but "comprehensive guide" feels more fitting in context.}}
2. {{In the translation of "En effektiv och uppfattande guide till bilder för 2023" as "An Effective and Comprehensive Guide to Images for 2023," the word "uppfattande" is translated as "comprehensive." The term "comprehensive" better conveys the intent of providing a thorough and complete guide.}}
3. {{The translation retains the technical accuracy and intent of the original markdown, links, and HTML code blocks.}}
