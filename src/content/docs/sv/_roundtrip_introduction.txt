**Efficient and Opinionated Guide to Images for 2023**

Check the sidebar for deep dive. This is the quick reference to upgrade your `<img>` tags to handle modern devices of all different sizes and pixel densities. You should [know that pixels != pixels](/en/pixels-arent-pixels) and `devicePixelRatio` is more likely around 3.875 than 1:1. Modern phones pretend to be 320-428px wide for legibility.

> If your image never changes size no matter how narrow you make the browser window, you should instead use a [density descriptor](/en/density-descriptors). This is often appropriate for logos, icons, and buttons.

Do you know what your [breakpoints](/en/breakpoints) are? You'll need these numbers to fine-tune the solution below - and at a minimum, the viewport width breakpoint where the main content area stops expanding.


### The Simple Method

```html

<img src="img.jpg?w=480"
     srcset="img.jpg?format=webp&w=480 480w, 
             img.jpg?format=webp&w=800 800w, 
             img.jpg?format=webp&w=1200 1200w, 
             img.jpg?format=webp&w=1600 1600w, 
             img.jpg?format=webp&w=2000 2000w"
     sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 800px" alt="Dog riding a bike" />

<!-- We've assumed you have a breakpoint at 700px. 
     And that below that viewport width, this image takes up 100% width, but
     when the viewport is larger, the image is constrained to 800 CSS pixels wide -->

<!-- This also assumes you're using an RIAPI-compliant image server like Imageflow. 
     Creating image variants on-the-fly is necessary for developer health. -->
