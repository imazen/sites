**An efficient and strict guide to images for 2023**

Check the sidebar for a deep dive. This is the quick reference for upgrading `<img>` tags to handle modern devices at all their different sizes and pixel densities. You should [know that pixels != pixels](/en/pixels-not-pixels) and `devicePixelRatio` is more likely to be around 3.875 than 1:1. Modern phones pretend to be 320-428px wide for legibility (in CSS pixels), but have many actual pixels per CSS pixel.

> If your image never changes size regardless of how narrow the window gets, you should use [a density descriptor](/en/density-descriptors) instead. This often works well for logos, icons, and buttons.

Do you know what your [breakpoints](/en/breakpoints) are? You'll need those numbers to fine-tune the solution below, and at minimum the breakpoint at which your main content area stops growing.


### The simple way

```html
<img src="img.jpg?w=480"
        srcset="img.jpg?format=webp&w=480 480w,
                img.jpg?format=webp&w=800 800w,
                img.jpg?format=webp&w=1200 1200w,
                img.jpg?format=webp&w=1600 1600w,
                img.jpg?format=webp&w=2000 2000w"

        sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 800px" alt="Dog riding a bicycle" />

<!-- We've assumed you have a breakpoint at 700px. 
      And that below that width the image takes up 100% of the width, but
      above that width the image is limited to 800 CSS pixels -->

<!-- This assumes you're using an RIAPI-compatible image server like Imageflow. 
     Dynamic image variant production is crucial for developer sanity. -->
```
