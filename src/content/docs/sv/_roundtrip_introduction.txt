**An efficient and restrictive guide to images for 2023**

Check the sidebar for a comprehensive guide. This is a quick reference to upgrade your `<img>` tags to handle modern devices in all their different sizes and pixel densities. You should [know that pixels are not created equal](/en/pixels-not-pixels) and `devicePixelRatio` is more likely to be 3.875 than 1:1. Modern phones pretend to be between 320 and 428 pixels wide for easier reading.

> If your image never changes size, no matter how narrow the browser window gets, you should instead use a [density descriptor](/en/density-descriptors). This often works well for logos, icons, and buttons.

Do you know what your [breakpoints](/en/breakpoints) are? You'll need these numbers to fine-tune the solution below - and at least the breakpoint where the main content area stops growing.

### The easy way

```html

<img src="img.jpg?w=480" 
    srcset="img.jpg?format=webp&w=480 480w, 
        img.jpg?format=webp&w=800 800w,
        img.jpg?format=webp&w=1200 1200w, 
        img.jpg?format=webp&w=1600 1600w, 
        img.jpg?format=webp&w=2000 2000w"
    sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 800px" alt="Dog riding a bike" />

<!-- We assume you have a breakpoint at 700px.
    And that below that, the image fills 100% of the width, but
    above that, the width is limited to 800 CSS pixels -->

<!-- This also assumes that you are using an RIAPI-compliant image server such as Imageflow. 
    A crucial tool in developer sanity is on-the-fly image variant production. -->
