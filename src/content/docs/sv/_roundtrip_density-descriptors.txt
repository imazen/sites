Srcset with density descriptors offers a simple and effective method for delivering the most appropriate image to each user's device, thereby improving performance and user experience. This guide will walk you through the basics of using srcset with density descriptors and provide markup examples for your convenience.

## What is Srcset with Density Descriptors?

Srcset is an HTML attribute that allows you to specify multiple image sources for a single `<img>` element. Density descriptors (`x`) are used with srcset to provide images with different resolutions depending on the pixel resolution of the user's screen.

## When to Use Srcset with Density Descriptors

Using srcset with density descriptors is particularly useful when you want to:
1. Serve high-resolution images to high-DPI screens (e.g., Retina displays) while serving lower-resolution images to standard displays.
2. Improve page performance by delivering the most suitable image size to each user's device.

## Implementation of Srcset with Density Descriptors

To use srcset with density descriptors, follow these steps:
1. Prepare your images in various resolutions.
2. Add the `srcset` attribute to the `<img>` element, including the image sources and corresponding density descriptors.
3. Add the `sizes` attribute (optional) to specify the size of the image as it will be displayed on the screen.

### Markup Example

Here is an example of how to implement srcset with density descriptors in your markup:

```html
<img src="example-image-1x.jpg"
     srcset="example-image-1x.jpg 1x, example-image-2x.jpg 2x, example-image-3x.jpg 3x"
     alt="An example image">
```

This markup example includes:
- **src** : The default image source that is displayed if the browser does not support srcset.
- **srcset** : The list of image sources and their density descriptors (1x, 2x, 3x). The browser will select the most appropriate image based on the user's screen.
- **alt** : A description of the image for accessibility purposes.

And that's it! You have successfully implemented srcset with density descriptors, enhancing your website's performance and user experience.
