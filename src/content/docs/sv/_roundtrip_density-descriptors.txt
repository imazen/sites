Srcset with density descriptors provides a simple and efficient method for delivering the most suitable image to each user's device, improving performance and user experience. This guide will take you through the basics of using srcset with density descriptors and provide examples of markup for your convenience.

## What is Srcset with Density Descriptors?

Srcset is an HTML attribute designed to let you specify multiple image sources for a single `<img>` element. Density descriptors (`x`) are used in conjunction with srcset to provide images of different resolutions based on the user's screen pixel density.

## When to Use Srcset with Density Descriptors

Using srcset with density descriptors is particularly useful when you want to:
1. Display high-resolution images on high-DPI screens (e.g. Retina displays) while providing lower resolution images for standard screens.
2. Improve page performance by delivering the most appropriate image size for each user's device.

## Implementing Srcset with Density Descriptors

To use srcset with density descriptors, follow these steps:
1. Prepare your images in different resolutions.
2. Add the `srcset` attribute to the `<img>` element, including image sources and corresponding density descriptors.
3. Add the `sizes` attribute (optional) to specify the size of the image when displayed on the screen.

### Example Markup

Here’s an example of how to implement srcset with density descriptors in your markup:

```html
<img src="example-image-1x.jpg"
     srcset="example-image-1x.jpg 1x, example-image-2x.jpg 2x, example-image-3x.jpg 3x"
     alt="An example image">
```

This markup example includes:
- **src**: The default image source, displayed if the browser does not support srcset.
- **srcset**: The list of image sources and their density descriptors (1x, 2x, 3x). The browser chooses the most suitable image based on the user's screen.
- **alt**: A description of the image for accessibility purposes.

And that’s it! You’ve successfully implemented srcset with density descriptors, improving your website’s performance and user experience.
