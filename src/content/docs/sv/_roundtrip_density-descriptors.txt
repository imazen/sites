Srcset with density descriptions provides a simple and effective method for delivering the most appropriate image to each user's device, improving performance and user experience. This guide covers the basics of using srcset with density descriptions and provides examples of markup for your convenience.

## What is Srcset with Density Descriptions?

Srcset is an HTML attribute designed to allow you to specify multiple image sources for a single `<img>` element. Density descriptions (`x`) are used in combination with srcset to provide images with different resolutions based on the user's screen pixel density.

## When to Use Srcset with Density Descriptions?

Using srcset with density descriptions is particularly useful when you want to:
1. Serve high-resolution images to high-resolution displays (e.g. Retina displays) while providing lower-resolution images to regular displays.
2. Improve page performance by delivering the most appropriate image size to each user's device.

## Implementation of Srcset with Density Descriptions

Follow these steps to use srcset with density descriptions:
1. Prepare your images in different resolutions.
2. Add the `srcset` attribute to the `<img>` element, including image sources and corresponding density descriptions.
3. Add the `sizes` attribute (optional) to specify the image size as it will appear on the screen.

### Example Markup

Here is an example of how you can implement srcset with density descriptions in your markup:

```html
<img src="example-image-1x.jpg"
     srcset="example-image-1x.jpg 1x, example-image-2x.jpg 2x, example-image-3x.jpg 3x"
     alt="An example image">
```

This markup example includes:
- **src**: The standard image source displayed if the browser does not support srcset.
- **srcset**: The list of image sources and their density descriptions (1x, 2x, 3x). The browser selects the most appropriate image based on the user's display.
- **alt**: A description of the image for accessibility purposes.

And that's it! You have successfully implemented srcset with density descriptions and improved your website's performance and user experience.
