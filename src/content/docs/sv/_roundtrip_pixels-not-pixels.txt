### Device pixels ≠ CSS pixels ≠ image pixels

Thanks to Apple, CSS and HTML pixels (`px`) are almost always mapped to **multiple device/print pixels**. The devicePixelRatio on my phone is 3.875; [what's yours?](https://www.mydevice.io/)

My computer's devicePixelRatio changes with browser zoom, but is set to 1.5 by default (because my `System > Display > Scale` is set to 150%).

Image files (except for SVG) are decoded into an array of pixels. **It's hard to display image pixels perfectly in a 1:1 relationship with device pixels, but with `srcset` you can get *close enough* and with some JavaScript you can adjust the size of the html element after loading it if you have a really compelling reason to need that perfect mapping, although such forbidden tricks won't be revealed here.

> Other absolute [units (in, pc, pt, mm, cm, Q)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/length) are defined in terms of CSS pixels and pretend everything has a resolution of 96 dpi. Developers avoid absolute units because it's better to use units that come from the font size or viewport/container dimensions. Incorrect units can break a layout if the user adjusts their `Accessibility > Text Size` multiplier, zooms in the browser, or rotates their device. As you can understand, all of these should be done before launching your website.
