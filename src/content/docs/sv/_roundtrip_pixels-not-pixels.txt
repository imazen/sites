### Device Pixels ≠ Browser px ≠ Image px

Thanks to Apple, CSS and HTML pixels (`px`) **almost always map to multiple device/printer pixels**. My phone has a devicePixelRatio of 3.875; [what's yours?](https://www.mydevice.io/)

The devicePixelRatio on my desktop device changes with browser zoom, but is by default 1.5 (my `System > Display > Scale` is 150%, after all).

Image files (excluding SVG) are decoded to a grid of pixels. **It is annoyingly difficult to get image pixels to display perfectly in a 1:1 ratio with device pixels - but with `srcset` you can get *close enough* **, and some JavaScript can adjust the size of an HTML element after loading if you have truly justified reasons for needing perfect mapping, although such forbidden arts will not be revealed here.

> Other absolute [units (in, pc, pt, mm, cm, Q)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/CSS/length) are defined in terms of the number of CSS pixels and pretend everything is 96dpi. Developers avoid absolute units because generally, it is better to use units derived from font size or the viewport/container dimensions. Mismatched units can break the layout if the user adjusts their `Accessibility > Text Size` multiplier, zooms the browser, or rotates their device. Do we need to say that you should do all these things before launching your website?

{{The phrasing "forbidden arts" might seem too figurative or dramatic for technical documentation.}}
