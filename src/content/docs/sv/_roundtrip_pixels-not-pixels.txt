### Unit pixels ≠ browser pixels ≠ image pixels

Thanks to Apple, CSS and HTML pixels (`px`) **almost always map to several device/print pixels**. The `devicePixelRatio` on my phone is 3.875; [what's yours?](https://www.mydevice.io/)

My desktop's `devicePixelRatio` changes with the browser zoom, but defaults to 1.5 (because my `System > Display > Scale` is set to 150%).

Image files (excluding SVG) decode to an array of pixels. **Getting image pixels to display perfectly 1:1 with device pixels is annoyingly hard—but with `srcset` you can get *close enough***, and a little bit of JavaScript can adjust the HTML element's dimensions after loading if you have a truly compelling reason for needing that perfect match—although such forbidden sorcery shall not be revealed here.

> Other absolute [units (in, pc, pt, mm, cm, Q)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/length) are defined in terms of CSS pixels pretending everything is 96dpi. Developers mostly avoid absolute units because it's usually better to use units derived from font-size or viewport/container dimensions. Using incorrect units can break a layout if the user adjusts their `Accessibility > Text Size` multiplier, zooms the browser, or rotates their device. Needless to say, you should do all these things before launching your site.
