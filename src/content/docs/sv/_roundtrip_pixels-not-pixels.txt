### Device Pixels ≠ Browser Pixels ≠ Image Pixels

Thanks to Apple, CSS and HTML pixels (`px`) **almost always map to multiple device/browser pixels**. The `devicePixelRatio` on my phone is 3.875; [what's yours?](https://www.mydevice.io/)

My desktop's `devicePixelRatio` changes when I zoom the browser, but it's typically 1.5 (my `System > Display > Scale` is 150% by default).

Image files (excluding SVG) are decoded into a grid of pixels. **It's annoyingly hard to get image pixels to display perfectly with a 1:1 correspondence to device pixels, but with `srcset` you can come *reasonably close***, and with a bit of JavaScript you can adjust the HTML element's size after it loads if you have a really good reason for needing that perfect match, though such forbidden sorcery won't be revealed here.

> Other absolute [units (in, pc, pt, mm, cm, Q)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/length) are defined in terms of actual CSS pixels pretending everything is 96dpi. Developers avoid absolute units because it's generally better to use units derived from font-size or viewport/container dimensions. Mismatched units can break layout if the user adjusts their `Accessibility > Text Size` multiplier, zooms the browser, or rotates their device. Obviously, you should do all those things before you ship your site. {{Note that the term used here is not the technical term, so it may be confusing for some readers.}}
