### Unit pixels ≠ browser pixels ≠ image pixels

Thanks to Apple, CSS and HTML pixels (`px`) **almost always map to multiple device/printer pixels**. The devicePixelRatio on my phone is 3.875; [what's yours?](https://www.mydevice.io/)

The devicePixelRatio on my desktop changes with browser zooming, but is a default of 1.5 (since my `System > Display > Scale` is 150%).

Image files (excluding SVG) decode to an array of pixels. **It's annoyingly hard to get image pixels to appear perfectly in 1:1 correspondence with device pixels - but with `srcset` you can get *close enough***, and a little JavaScript can adjust the HTML element size after load if you have truly motivated reasons for needing the perfect match, though such forbidden tricks are not disclosed here.

> Other absolute [units (in, pc, pt, mm, cm, Q)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/length) are defined in terms of the number of CSS pixels and pretend that everything is 96 dpi. Developers avoid absolute units because it's usually better to use units derived from font size or from viewport/container dimensions. Wrong units can break a layout if the user adjusts their `Accessibility > Text Size` multiplier, zooms the browser, or rotates their device. Needless to say, you should do all these things before launching your website.
