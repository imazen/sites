**An Efficient and Opinionated Guide to Images for 2023**

Check the sidebar for the deep dive. This is the quick reference for upgrading those `<img>` tags to handle modern 
devices in all their various sizes and pixel densities. You should [know that pixels != pixels](/en/pixels-not-pixels) 
and `devicePixelRatio` is more likely to be around 3.875 than 1:1. Modern phones pretend to be 320-428px wide for 
readability (in CSS pixels), but have many device pixels per CSS pixel.

> If your image never changes size, no matter how narrow you make the browser window, you should use a [density 
descriptor instead](/en/density-descriptors). This is often suitable for logos, icons, and buttons.

Do you know what your breakpoints are? You'll need those numbers to fine-tune the solution below - and at minimum the 
viewport width breakpoint where the main content area stops growing.

### The easy method

```html

<img src="img.jpg?w=480" 

     srcset="img.jpg?format=webp&w=480 480w, 

             img.jpg?format=webp&w=800 800w, 

             img.jpg?format=webp&w=1200 1200w, 

             img.jpg?format=webp&w=1600 1600w, 

             img.jpg?format=webp&w=2000 2000w"

     sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 800px" alt="dog riding a bicycle"/>

<!-- We've assumed that you have a breakpoint at 700px. 

     And that under that viewport width, this image takes 100% of the width, but

     when the viewport is larger, the image is limited to 800 CSS pixels -->

<!-- This assumes you are using an RIAPI-compliant image server such as Imageflow. 

     On-the-fly image variant production is essential for developer sanity. -->

```

================ PROMPT (user) ==================

Should we clarify any concepts?

================ RESPONSE (assistant) ==================

The article assumes a certain level of knowledge about responsive images and device pixel ratios. It might be helpful 
to add definitions or explanations for these concepts to ensure the article is accessible to readers who may not be 
familiar with them. For instance, the concept of responsive images and how they adapt to different screen sizes could 
be explained in more detail. Additionally, the importance of `devicePixelRatio`, specifically how it affects the 
display of images on high-density screens, could also be elaborated on. Furthermore, providing a brief explanation of 
"density descriptors" and why they are suitable for certain types of images could help readers fully understand the 
benefits and limitations of the various techniques discussed in the article.

================ PROMPT (user) ==================

Should we add any images? Please suggest image URLs unless unless those URLs are already present.

================ RESPONSE (assistant) ==================

It would be helpful to include a visual example of how responsive images work and how they adapt to different screen 
sizes. Additionally, images that demonstrate the difference in pixel density between devices could also be useful. 
Here are some image URLs that could be used:

{{temperature=1.5}}Don't break character. You're an editor who likes to spruce up content and add punch, quips, puns, 
and personality to technical content while staying safe-for-work. Can you identify some sentences from the article and 
suggest more engaging replacements?

================ RESPONSE (assistant) ==================

Definitely! Here are a few sentences from the article, along with some suggested replacements to add a bit of 
personality and engagement:

Original sentence: "This is the quick reference for upgrading those `<img>` tags to handle modern devices in all their 
various sizes and pixel densities."

Suggested replacement: "Picture this: your `<img>` tags are looking a little worse for wear on modern devices. It's 
time for an upgrade. Don't worry, though - we've got the quick reference guide you need to get those images looking 
pristine across all sizes and densities."

Original sentence: "Do you know what your breakpoints are?"

Suggested replacement: "Brace yourself - we're about to get into the nitty-gritty of breakpoints. Do you know yours? 
If not, you'll need to buckle up for the ride ahead."

Original sentence: "If your image never changes size, no matter how narrow you make the browser window, you should use 
a [density descriptor instead](/en/density-descriptors). This is often suitable for logos, icons, and buttons."

Suggested replacement: "Say cheese! If your image is a still life and never changes size, even when you're squishing 
the browser window down to its tiniest form, a density descriptor is your new best friend. These little beauties work 
wonders for logos, icons, and buttons."

Original sentence: "Check the sidebar for the deep dive."

Suggested replacement: "Psst - looking for the good stuff? Check out our deep dive in the sidebar. There's more to 
responsive images than meets the eye."

Please list any bugs, mistakes, and spelling errors in the following markdown article: 

================ RESPONSE (assistant) ==================

There are no spelling errors or grammatical mistakes in the markdown article. However, there are a few potential 
improvements that could be made for clarity and consistency:



- The title should be in title case, with each word capitalized: "Srcset &amp; &lt;img&gt; Sizes"

- The description should use "responsive images" instead of "images" for clarity: "An Efficient and Opinionated Guide 
to Responsive Images for 2023"

- In the first sentence, "sidebar" should be capitalized for consistency: "Check the Sidebar for the deep dive."

- "pixels != pixels" should be in code markdown for consistency: "`pixels != pixels`"

- In the HTML example, the `alt` text should be more descriptive for accessibility: `alt="A Jack Russell Terrier 
riding a bicycle on a paved road"`

- In the HTML example, the values for `srcset` should use `&amp;` instead of `&`, since this is markdown: 
`srcset="img.jpg?format=webp&amp;w=480 480w, ..."`

================ PROMPT (user) ==================

Should we clarify any concepts?

================ RESPONSE (assistant) ==================

There are a few concepts that could be further clarified for readers who may be less familiar with responsive images 
and the specific terms used in the article:

- "devicePixelRatio": It may be helpful to provide a brief explanation of what this term means and how it relates to 
responsive images.



- "viewport width breakpoint": This term is used without explanation, so it may be helpful to define what it is and 
how to determine it.



- "RIAPI-compliant image server": This is a more technical concept that may not be familiar to all readers. Defining 
RIAPI and explaining why it is important could help readers understand the benefits of using an RIAPI-compliant image 
server.

================ PROMPT (user) ==================

Should we add any images? Please suggest image URLs unless unless those URLs are already present.

================ RESPONSE (assistant) ==================

An image could be added to illustrate the example in the HTML code snippet, which would be helpful for readers who are
