================ PROMPT (user) ==================

Should we clarify any concepts?

================ RESPONSE (assistant) ==================

The article provides a clear explanation of the concepts related to the usage of the `<picture>` element, responsive 
images, art direction, different image formats, and breakpoints. However, it might be helpful to provide more details 
on how to implement breakpoints using media queries in CSS, and how to determine the appropriate sizes for images 
based on the screen sizes.

================ PROMPT (user) ==================

Should we add any images? Please suggest image URLs unless unless those URLs are already present.

================ RESPONSE (assistant) ==================

It would be helpful to add some visual aids to support the explanation of the different examples. Here are some image 
URLs that could be used:

- For example 1, an image showing how the same image appears on different screen sizes. URL: https://
static.vecteezy.com/system/resources/previews/000/179/929/original/vector-responsive-design-illustration.jpg

- For example 2, an image showing a comparison between a wide screen and a portrait screen. URL: https://
cdn.dribbble.com/users/2921/screenshots/257201/art-direction.gif

- For example 3, an image showing a comparison of the same image in different file formats. URL: https://cdn-
images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*s8zy1LhJx4BH6pgOGKnO4g.png

These images could be embedded within the Markdown article to provide a more engaging and informative reading 
experience.
