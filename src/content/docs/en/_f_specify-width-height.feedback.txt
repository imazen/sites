Revision: "Want your web page to be a lean, mean (and super speedy) machine? Look no further than properly-specified 
width and height attributes for all your images!"

Original: "It is recommended to put width and height attributes in the HTML code for images because it helps the web

width and height attributes in your HTML for images. Your page will thank you."

needed to display the image, and avoid unnecessary reflows or repaints of the content as it loads."

of doing complicated math on the fly, preventing content from jumping around like a hyperactive squirrel."
