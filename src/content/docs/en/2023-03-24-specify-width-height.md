Why should you put width and height in the HTML?

> It is recommended to put width and height attributes in the HTML code for images because it helps the web browser to know the size of the image before it is fully loaded. This allows the browser to reserve the appropriate amount of space on the web page for the image, which prevents the content from jumping around as the image loads.
> 
> Additionally, specifying the width and height attributes for images can also help to improve the overall performance of the web page. When a browser knows the size of an image in advance, it can more accurately calculate the amount of space needed to display the image, and avoid unnecessary reflows or repaints of the content as it loads.
> 
> Overall, using the width and height attributes in the HTML code for images can improve the user experience by making the content load faster and reducing visual glitches.
