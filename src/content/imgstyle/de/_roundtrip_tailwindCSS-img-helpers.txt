TailwindCSS offers several utility classes for working with the `<img>` tag. Here are some of the most commonly used ones:

- `object-contain`: This class sets the image so that it fits within its container, while maintaining the aspect ratio. It will either shrink or enlarge the image to ensure that it fits in the container.
- `object-cover`: This class sets the image so that it covers the entire container, while maintaining the aspect ratio. It will either crop or shrink the image to ensure that it covers the container.
- `object-fill`: This class sets the image so that it fills the entire container, without maintaining the aspect ratio. This may cause the image to be stretched or compressed to fit in the container.
- `object-none`: This class sets the image to its natural size, without any resizing or cropping.
- `object-center`: This class centers the image horizontally and vertically within its container.
- `object-left`: This class aligns the image to the left within its container.
- `object-right`: This class aligns the image to the right within its container.
- `object-top`: This class aligns the image to the top edge of its container.
- `object-bottom`: This class aligns the image to the bottom edge of its container.

These classes can be used in conjunction with other TailwindCSS classes to further style your images, e.g., by setting a specific width or height, adding borders or shadows, or adjusting the opacity.
