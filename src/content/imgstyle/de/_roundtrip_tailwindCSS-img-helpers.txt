TailwindCSS offers several helper classes for working with the `<img>` tag. Here are some of the most commonly used ones:
- `object-contain`: This class adjusts the image inside its container while maintaining its aspect ratio. The image is either scaled down or up to fit within the container.
- `object-cover`: This class adjusts the image to fill the entire container while maintaining its aspect ratio. The image is either cropped or scaled down to fill the container.
- `object-fill`: This class adjusts the image to fill the entire container without maintaining its aspect ratio. This can cause the image to stretch or compress to fit within the container.
- `object-none`: This class uses the natural size of the image without scaling or constraining it.
- `object-center`: This class centers the image horizontally and vertically within its container.
- `object-left`: This class aligns the image to the left within its container.
- `object-right`: This class aligns the image to the right within its container.
- `object-top`: This class aligns the image to the top within its container.
- `object-bottom`: This class aligns the image to the bottom within its container.

These classes can be used in conjunction with other TailwindCSS classes to further style your images, such as setting a specific width or height, adding borders or shadows, or adjusting opacity.
