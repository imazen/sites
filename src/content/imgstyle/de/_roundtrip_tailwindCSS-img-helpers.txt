TailwindCSS provides several helper classes for working with the `<img>` tag. Here are some of the most commonly used ones:
- `object-contain`: This class adjusts the image within its container while maintaining its aspect ratio. The image is either reduced or enlarged to fit into the container.
- `object-cover`: This class adjusts the image to fill the entire container while maintaining its aspect ratio. The image is either cropped or reduced to fill the container.
- `object-fill`: This class adjusts the image to fill the entire container without maintaining its aspect ratio. This may stretch or compress the image to fit into the container.
- `object-none`: This class uses the natural size of the image without reducing or restricting it.
- `object-center`: This class centers the image horizontally and vertically within its container.
- `object-left`: This class aligns the image to the left within its container.
- `object-right`: This class aligns the image to the right within its container.
- `object-top`: This class aligns the image to the top within its container.
- `object-bottom`: This class aligns the image to the bottom within its container.

These classes can be used in conjunction with other TailwindCSS classes to further style your images, such as specifying a certain width or height, adding borders or shadows, or adjusting the opacity.
