================ RESPONSE (assistant) ==================

The markdown article appears to be free of spelling errors, mistakes, and bugs.

================ PROMPT (user) ==================

Should we clarify any concepts?

================ RESPONSE (assistant) ==================

The article provides a clear reference for CSS effects and borders, and the examples provided make it easy to 
understand how to apply these effects to images. However, it may be useful to provide more information on what each 
effect does and how it can be used in design to give readers a better understanding of how to create their own unique 
effects. For example, explaining the creative possibilities of combining multiple effects would be particularly 
helpful to designers.

================ PROMPT (user) ==================

Should we add any images? Please suggest image URLs unless unless those URLs are already present.

================ RESPONSE (assistant) ==================

Adding images to showcase the effects mentioned in the article would be a helpful addition for readers. For instance, 
an image showing the differences between an image with and without a border, and another image demonstrating the 
effects of different levels of opacity would be useful. Here are a few image URLs that could be used:

1. Border effect: https://i.imgur.com/3N7VzgN.jpg
