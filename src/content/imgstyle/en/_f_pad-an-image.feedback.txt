Should we clarify any concepts?

================ RESPONSE (assistant) ==================

The concepts presented in the article are clear and concise. However, one concept that could be clarified further is 
the purpose of the `::after` pseudo-element. It may be helpful to explain that it is used to create a new element (in 
this case, the padding below the image) without having to modify the HTML markup.
