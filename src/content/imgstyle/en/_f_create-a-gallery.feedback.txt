Should we clarify any concepts?

================ RESPONSE (assistant) ==================

The article seems to provide a clear and concise explanation of the steps to creating an image gallery on a website. 
However, it might be helpful to explain in more detail what each CSS property does and how it affects the layout and 
appearance of the gallery. Additionally, providing examples of how different CSS properties can be used to create 
different styles of galleries could be useful for readers who want to customize their gallery further.

================ PROMPT (user) ==================

Should we add any images? Please suggest image URLs unless unless those URLs are already present.

================ RESPONSE (assistant) ==================

It would be beneficial to add screenshots or images of a sample image gallery created using the given HTML and CSS 
code to help readers visualize the end result. We could also include a sample image to demonstrate how image inclusion 
works in HTML. Here are some potential image URLs:
