Should we clarify any concepts?

================ RESPONSE (assistant) ==================

The article provides a clear and concise tutorial on how to add a tap to view full-screen image option to a gallery 
using JavaScript and CSS. However, if the target audience may not be familiar with these concepts, it may be helpful 
to include some brief explanations or references to external resources that can help them understand the concepts. 

For example, a brief explanation on what JavaScript and CSS are and how they are used to create the overlay and 
display images in full-screen mode could be included. Additionally, references to resources or tutorials that assume a 
beginner level of understanding of these languages could be beneficial for readers who may feel overwhelmed by the 
technical nature of the article.

================ PROMPT (user) ==================

Should we add any images? Please suggest image URLs unless unless those URLs are already present.

================ RESPONSE (assistant) ==================

Adding images could be beneficial to show readers what the final product should look like. Here are some image URLs 
that could be included:

- An image of a gallery with the "Tap to View Full-Screen Image" option enabled: https://www.w3schools.com/howto/
img_fullscreen.jpg

- An image of the overlay that is created when the user clicks on the image: https://www.w3schools.com/howto/
img_overlay.jpg

Adding these images to the article could enhance the readers' understanding of the process and make it easier for them 
to follow along with the tutorial.
