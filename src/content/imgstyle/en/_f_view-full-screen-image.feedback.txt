title: Add tap to view full-screen image to a gallery

description: How to add a tap to view full-screen image option to a gallery

date_published: '2023-04-03'

To add a "Tap to view full-screen image" option to a gallery, you can use JavaScript and CSS to create an overlay that 
displays the image in full-screen mode when the user taps on it.

Here's a basic approach you can use:

1. First, create a container for your gallery and add all the images you want to display.

```html

<div class="gallery">

  <img src="image1.jpg">

  <img src="image2.jpg">

  <img src="image3.jpg">

  <!-- add more images here -->

</div>

```

2. Next, add some CSS to style the gallery and the images.

```css

.gallery {

  display: flex;

  flex-wrap: wrap;

}

.gallery img {

  width: 100%;

  height: auto;

  margin: 5px;

}

```

3. Now, add a click event listener to each image using JavaScript. When the user clicks on an image, the JavaScript 
will create an overlay and display the image in full-screen mode.

```javascript

const gallery = document.querySelector('.gallery');

const images = gallery.querySelectorAll('img');

images.forEach((image) => {

  image.addEventListener('click', () => {

    // create overlay

    const overlay = document.createElement('div');

    overlay.classList.add('overlay');

    

    // create image element

    const fullScreenImage = document.createElement('img');

    fullScreenImage.src = image.src;

    fullScreenImage.classList.add('full-screen-image');

    

    // add image element to overlay

    overlay.appendChild(fullScreenImage);

    

    // add overlay to page

    document.body.appendChild(overlay);

  });

});

```

4. Finally, add some CSS to style the overlay and the full-screen image.

```css

.overlay {

  position: fixed;

  top: 0;

  left: 0;

  width: 100%;

  height: 100%;

  background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.9);

  display: flex;

  justify-content: center;

  align-items: center;

}

.full-screen-image {

  max-width: 100%;

  max-height: 100%;

  object-fit: contain;

}

```

With these steps, you should now have a gallery that allows users to view images in full-screen mode by tapping on 
them.

Should we clarify any concepts?

================ RESPONSE (assistant) ==================

There are no major concepts in the article that require clarification. However, for readers who are not familiar with 
JavaScript or CSS, some additional context might be helpful. It could be useful to provide a brief explanation of what 
JavaScript and CSS are, and how they are used to create web pages and web applications. Additionally, a brief 
explanation of what event listeners are and how they work in JavaScript could also help readers who are new to web 
development.

================ PROMPT (user) ==================

Should we add any images? Please suggest image URLs unless unless those URLs are already present.

================ RESPONSE (assistant) ==================

Adding images to the article can help illustrate the steps involved in the process. Here are some potential images 
that could be added to the article:

1. Example gallery with multiple images: A screenshot of a sample gallery with multiple images would help illustrate 
the first step of creating a container for the gallery. Here's a URL where an example image can be found:  https://
www.pexels.com/photo/white-domesticated-rabbit-on-grass-lawn-39350/

2. Overlay with full-screen image: An image of the overlay with the full-screen image displayed would help readers 
visualize the final result of the code. Here's a URL for an example image: https://www.pexels.com/photo/photo-of-night-
sky-with-stars-1072825/

3. Click event listener: An image showing how to add a click event listener to an image could help readers who are not 
familiar with JavaScript. Here's a URL for a relevant image: https://www.pexels.com/photo/woman-using-laptop-computer-
on-wooden-desk-6478342/

Including these images can enhance the reader's understanding of the process involved in adding a tap-to-view full-
screen image option to a gallery.
