To add CSS effects and borders to an image, you can follow these steps:
1. Select the image element in your HTML code. You can do this using an ID or class selector, or by selecting the `<img>` element directly.
2. Define a CSS class or ID selector that applies the desired styles to the image. For example, you could use the following code to create a simple border around the image:

```css
.my-image {
  border: 2px solid black;
}
```

3. Apply the CSS class or ID selector to the image element. For example, if you used the `.my-image` selector in step 2, you can add the following code to your HTML to apply the styles to the image:

```html
<img src="path/to/image.jpg" class="my-image">
```

4. Customize the styles as desired. In addition to borders, you can apply a wide range of CSS effects to images, such as filters, opacity, transitions, and animations. Here are some examples of CSS code that can be used to add effects to images:

```css
/* Add a shadow effect */
.my-image {
  box-shadow: 0 0 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);
}

/* Add a grayscale filter effect */
.my-image {
  filter: grayscale(100%);
}

/* Add a zoom transition effect on hover */
.my-image {
  transition: transform 0.3s ease;
}
.my-image:hover {
  transform: scale(1.1);
}
```

These are just a few examples of the many CSS effects and borders that you can use to enhance your images. Experiment with different styles to find the ones that work best for your design.

{{Note that "selettore ID" in Italian translates to "ID selector" in English, which may be less clear in context.}} 
{{The phrase “a wide range of CSS effects to images” could be more clearly stated as “a wide range of CSS effects for images.”}} 
{{“Enhance your images” may imply a higher quality, which could be replaced with “improve your images” for clarity.}}
