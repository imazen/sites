TailwindCSS provides several support classes for working with the `<img>` tag. Here are some of the most commonly used ones:

- `object-contain`: This class sets the image to fit inside the container while maintaining its aspect ratio. It will shrink or enlarge the image as needed to fit inside the container.
- `object-cover`: This class sets the image to cover the entire container while maintaining its aspect ratio. The image will be cropped or shrunk as needed to cover the container.
- `object-fill`: This class sets the image to fill the entire container without maintaining its aspect ratio. This can cause the image to distort or compress to fit inside the container. 
- `object-none`: This class sets the image to its natural size without resizing or cropping it. 
- `object-center`: This class horizontally and vertically centers the image inside the container.
- `object-left`: This class aligns the image to the left inside the container.
- `object-right`: This class aligns the image to the right inside the container.
- `object-top`: This class aligns the image at the top of the container.
- `object-bottom`: This class aligns the image at the bottom of the container.

These classes can be used in conjunction with other TailwindCSS classes to further style the images, such as setting a specific width or height, adding borders or shadows, or adjusting the opacity.

{{Note that the term "container" refers to the parent element of the `<img>` tag.}}
