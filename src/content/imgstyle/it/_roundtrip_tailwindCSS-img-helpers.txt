TailwindCSS provides several helper classes for working with the `<img>` tag. Here are some of the most commonly used ones:

- `object-contain`: This class sets the image to fit inside the container while maintaining its aspect ratio. The image will be scaled down or up if needed to ensure that it fits inside the container.
- `object-cover`: This class sets the image to cover the entire container while maintaining its aspect ratio. The image will be cropped or scaled down if needed to cover the container.
- `object-fill`: This class sets the image to fill the entire container without maintaining its aspect ratio. This can result in the image being stretched or compressed to fit inside the container.
- `object-none`: This class sets the image to its natural size without resizing or cropping.
- `object-center`: This class centers the image both horizontally and vertically inside the container.
- `object-left`: This class aligns the image to the left inside the container.
- `object-right`: This class aligns the image to the right inside the container.
- `object-top`: This class aligns the image to the top inside the container.
- `object-bottom`:  This class aligns the image to the bottom inside the container.

These classes can be used in conjunction with other TailwindCSS classes to further style images, such as setting a specific width or height, adding borders or shadows, or adjusting opacity.
