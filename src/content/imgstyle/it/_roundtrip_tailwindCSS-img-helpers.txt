TailwindCSS provides several helper classes for working with the `<img>` tag. Here are some of the most commonly used:

- `object-contain`: This class sets the image to fit within the container while maintaining its aspect ratio. It can reduce or expand the image as needed to ensure it fits the container.
- `object-cover`: This class sets the image to cover the entire container while maintaining its aspect ratio. It may crop or reduce the image as needed to ensure it covers the container.
- `object-fill`: This class sets the image to fill the entire container without maintaining the aspect ratio. This can cause the image to stretch or compress to fit the container.
- `object-none`: This class sets the image to its natural size without any resizing or cropping.
- `object-center`: This class centers the image both horizontally and vertically within its container.
- `object-left`: This class aligns the image to the left within its container.
- `object-right`: This class aligns the image to the right within its container.
- `object-top`: This class aligns the image to the top of the container.
- `object-bottom`: This class aligns the image to the bottom of the container.

These classes can be used alongside other TailwindCSS classes to further style your images, such as setting a specific width or height, adding borders or shadows, or adjusting opacity.
