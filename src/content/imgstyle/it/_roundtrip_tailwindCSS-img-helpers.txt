TailwindCSS provides various support classes to work with the `<img>` tag. Here are some of the commonly used ones:
- `object-contain`: This class sets the image to fit the container while maintaining its aspect ratio. If necessary, it will shrink or enlarge the image to fit within the container.
- `object-cover`: This class sets the image to cover the entire container while maintaining its aspect ratio. The image will be cropped or scaled down if necessary to cover the container.
- `object-fill`: This class sets the image to fill the entire container, without maintaining its aspect ratio. This can cause distortion or compression of the image to fit within the container.
- `object-none`: This class sets the image to its natural dimensions, without resizing or cropping it.
- `object-center`: This class centers the image horizontally and vertically within the container.
- `object-left`: This class aligns the image to the left within the container.
- `object-right`: This class aligns the image to the right within the container.
- `object-top`: This class aligns the image to the top of the container.
- `object-bottom`: This class aligns the image to the bottom of the container.

These classes can be used in combination with other TailwindCSS classes for further styling of images, such as setting a specific width or height, adding borders or shadows, or adjusting opacity.
