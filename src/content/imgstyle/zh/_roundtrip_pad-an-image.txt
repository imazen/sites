Here's how to center and pad images with aspect ratio using CSS:

1. First, you'll need to wrap the image in a container element (like a <div> or <figure>). This will allow you to apply styles to the container that affect the image inside.

2. Set the container's `position` property to relative. This will allow you to position the image inside the container.

3. Add a pseudo-element `::after` to the container, which will be used to maintain the image's aspect ratio and create the padding.

4. Set the `content` property of the `::after` pseudo-element to an empty string. This is necessary to create the element.

5. Set the `padding-bottom` property of the `::after` pseudo-element to a percentage value corresponding to the aspect ratio of the image. For example, if your image has a 4:3 aspect ratio, you should set the padding to 75% (because 3/4 = 0.75). This will create the padding below the image.

6. Set the `position` property of the `::after` pseudo-element to absolute. This will position the element inside the container.

7. Set the `top`, `left`, `bottom`, and `right` properties of the `::after` pseudo-element to `0`. This will cause the element to fill the container, creating the padding.

8. Finally, set the `position` property of the image itself to absolute. This will allow you to use the `top`, `left`, `bottom`, and `right` properties to center the image within the container.

Here's an example CSS code for centering and padding an image with a 4:3 aspect ratio:

```css
.container {
  position: relative;
  width: 100%;
}

.container::after {
  content: "";
  display: block;
  padding-bottom: 75%; /* 4:3 aspect ratio */
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
  bottom: 0;
  right: 0;
}

img {
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
  bottom: 0;
  right: 0;
  margin: auto;
  max-width: 100%;
  max-height: 100%;
}
```

In this example, the `.container` element is the image's container. Use the `::after` pseudo-element to create padding and maintain the image's aspect ratio. The `img` element is set to `position: absolute` so that it can be centered within the container using the `top`, `left`, `bottom`, and `right` properties.

Set the `max-width` and `max-height` properties of the image to `100%` so that the image will scale proportionally to fit the available space. This means that the padding created by the `::after` pseudo-element will always be proportional to the size of the image.
