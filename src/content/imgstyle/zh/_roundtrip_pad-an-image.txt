Here is how to use CSS and aspect ratio to center and pad an image:
1. First, wrap the image in a container element, such as `<div>` or `<figure>`. This will allow you to style the container, thereby affecting the image inside.
2. Set the `position` property of the container to `relative`. This will allow you to position the image within the container.
3. Add an `::after` pseudo-element to the container. This will be used to maintain the aspect ratio of the image and create padding.
4. Set the `content` property of the `::after` pseudo-element to an empty string. This is required to create the element.
5. Set the `padding-bottom` property of the `::after` pseudo-element to a percentage value corresponding to the aspect ratio of the image. For example, if your image has an aspect ratio of 4:3, you should set the padding to `75%` (because 3/4 = 0.75). This will create padding below the image.
6. Set the `position` property of the `::after` pseudo-element to `absolute`. This will position the element within the container.
7. Set the `top`, `left`, `bottom`, and `right` properties of the `::after` pseudo-element to `0`. This will make the element fill the container, creating the padding.
8. Finally, set the `position` property of the image itself to `absolute`. This will allow you to use the `top`, `left`, `bottom`, and `right` properties to center the image within the container.

Below is an example using CSS code to center and pad an image with an aspect ratio of 4:3:

```css
.container {
  position: relative;
  width: 100%;
}

.container::after {
  content: "";
  display: block;
  padding-bottom: 75%; /* 4:3 aspect ratio */
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
  bottom: 0;
  right: 0;
}

img {
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
  bottom: 0;
  right: 0;
  margin: auto;
  max-width: 100%;
  max-height: 100%;
}
```

In this example, the `.container` element is the container for the image. The `::after` pseudo-element is used to create padding and maintain the aspect ratio of the image. The `img` element is set to `position: absolute`, allowing the use of `top`, `left`, `bottom`, and `right` properties to center it within the container.

By setting the `max-width` and `max-height` properties of the image to `100%`, the image will scale proportionally to fit the available space while maintaining its aspect ratio. This means that the padding created by the `::after` pseudo-element will always be proportional to the size of the image.
