# Setting the Style and Layout of `<img>` Elements

## Setting the Style of `<img>` Elements

You can use CSS to set the style of `<img>` elements, such as changing their size, border, and position.

For example, to make an image a certain size, you can use the `width` and `height` properties:

```css
img {
  width: 200px;
  height: 150px;
}
```

To add a border or change its color, you can use the `border` property:

```css
img {
  border: 1px solid black;
}
```

You can also use the `margin` and `padding` properties to control the spacing around the image:

```css
img {
  margin: 10px;
  padding: 5px;
}
```

## Example Layouts with `<img>` Elements

### Centering an Image

To center an image on a webpage, you can use the following CSS:

```css
img {
  display: block;
  margin: 0 auto;
}
```

This will set the image to display as a block element, and then set the left and right margins to auto, which centers the image along the horizontal axis.

### Aligning Images Horizontally

To align images horizontally, you can use the `text-align` property on the containing element:

```css
.container {
  text-align: center;
}
```

This will center any content, including images, inside the container element.

### Creating a Gallery Layout

To create a gallery layout with a grid of images, you can use CSS grid:

```css
.gallery {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(4, 1fr);
  grid-gap: 10px;
}
```

This will create a grid with 4 columns and an equal fraction of space for each column. The `grid-gap` property sets the amount of space between each image. You can adjust the number of columns or the gap size to fit your design. 

{{Note that the CSS grid property is not supported by some older browsers, such as Internet Explorer.}}
