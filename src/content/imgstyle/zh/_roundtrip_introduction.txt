Modern CSS provides developers with streamlined, efficient tools for powerful image handling:

- **Aspect Ratio:**  
  The `aspect-ratio` property enforces a fixed aspect ratio, stabilizing layouts by preventing unexpected shifts when images load.  
  ```css  
  .container {  
    aspect-ratio: 16/9;  
  }  
  ```

- **Object Fit and Object Position:**  
  Use `object-fit` (e.g., `cover`, `contain`) and `object-position` to precisely control image scaling and alignment within containers, eliminating awkward cropping or distortion.  
  ```css  
  img {  
    object-fit: cover;  
    object-position: center;  
  }  
  ```

- **Resolution-Adaptive Image Sets:**  
  The `image-set()` function provides resolution switching for background images, ensuring optimal clarity on high DPI devices.  
  ```css  
  .hero {  
    background-image: image-set(url("hero.png") 1x, url("hero@2x.png") 2x);  
  }  
  ```

- **Other Enhancements:**  
  `image-rendering` fine-tunes scaling algorithms for sharp output (ideal for pixel art), while `filter` allows implementing dynamic visual effects directly in CSS.

These features significantly simplify image presentation, reducing the reliance on JavaScript tricks and complex solutions, thereby greatly easing daily development tasks.
