To add CSS effects and borders to images, you can follow these steps:

1. Select the image element in your HTML code. You can use an ID or class selector, or directly select the `<img>` element.

2. Define a CSS class or ID selector to apply the desired styles to the image. For example, you can create a simple border for the image with the following code:

```css
.my-image {
  border: 2px solid black;
}
```

3. Apply the CSS class or ID selector to the image element. For instance, if you used the `.my-image` selector in step 2, you can add the following code in HTML to apply the style to the image:

```html
<img src="path/to/image.jpg" class="my-image">
```

4. Customize the styles as needed. In addition to borders, you can apply various CSS effects to the image, such as filters, opacity, transitions, and animations. Below are some CSS code examples that can be used to add effects to images:

```css
/* Add a shadow effect */
.my-image {
  box-shadow: 0 0 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);
}

/* Add a grayscale filter effect */
.my-image {
  filter: grayscale(100%);
}

/* Add a zoom transition effect on hover */
.my-image {
  transition: transform 0.3s ease;
}
.my-image:hover {
  transform: scale(1.1);
}
```

These are just a few examples of the many CSS effects and borders you can use to enhance images. Try different styles to find the one that best suits your design.
