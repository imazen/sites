To add CSS effects and borders to an image, you can follow these steps:
1. Select the image element in your HTML code. You can do this using an ID selector or class selector, or by directly selecting the `<img>` element.
2. Define a CSS class or ID selector to apply the desired styles to the image. For example, you can use the following code to create a simple border for the image:

```css
.my-image {
  border: 2px solid black;
}
```

3. Apply the CSS class or ID selector to the image element. For example, if you used the `.my-image` selector in step 2, you can add the following code to your HTML to apply the styles to the image:

```html
<img src="path/to/image.jpg" class="my-image">
```

4. Customize the styles as needed. In addition to borders, you can apply various CSS effects to the image, such as filters, opacity, transitions, and animations. Here are some examples of CSS code that you can use to add effects to images:

```css
/* Add shadow effect */
.my-image {
  box-shadow: 0 0 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);
}

/* Add grayscale filter effect */
.my-image {
  filter: grayscale(100%);
}

/* Add scale transition effect on hover */
.my-image {
  transition: transform 0.3s ease;
}
.my-image:hover {
  transform: scale(1.1);
}
```

These are just a few examples of the many CSS effects and borders you can use to enhance your images. Experiment with different styles to find the effects that best suit your design.
