To add CSS effects and borders to images, follow these steps:

1. Select the image element in your HTML code. You can do this by using an ID or class selector, or by directly selecting the `<img>` element.

2. Define the CSS class or ID selector that applies the desired styles. For example, you can create a simple image border using the following code:

```css
.my-image {
  border: 2px solid black;
}
```

3. Apply the CSS class or ID selector to the image element. For example, if you used the `.my-image` selector in step 2, you can add the following code to your HTML to apply the style to the image:

```html
<img src="path/to/image.jpg" class="my-image">
```

4. Customize the style as needed. In addition to borders, you can apply a variety of CSS effects to your images, such as filters, opacity, transitions, and animations. Here are some examples of CSS code that can be used to add effects to your images:

```css
/* Add a shadow effect */
.my-image {
  box-shadow: 0 0 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);
}

/* Add a grayscale filter effect */
.my-image {
  filter: grayscale(100%);
}

/* Add a scaling transition effect on hover */
.my-image {
  transition: transform 0.3s ease;
}
.my-image:hover {
  transform: scale(1.1);
}
```

These are just a few examples of the many CSS effects and borders that can be used to enhance your images. Experiment with different styles to find the ones that work best for your designs.
