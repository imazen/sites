TailwindCSS provides several utility classes for handling `<img>` tags. Here are some of the most commonly used utility classes:

- `object-contain`: This class sets the image to fit within its container while maintaining its aspect ratio. It will shrink or expand the image as needed to ensure it fits the container.
- `object-cover`: This class sets the image to cover the entire container while maintaining its aspect ratio. It will crop or shrink the image as needed to ensure it covers the container.
- `object-fill`: This class sets the image to fill the entire container without maintaining its aspect ratio. This might cause the image to stretch or compress to fit the container.
- `object-none`: This class sets the image to its natural size, without any adjustments or cropping.
- `object-center`: This class centers the image both horizontally and vertically within its container.
- `object-left`: This class aligns the image to the left side of its container.
- `object-right`: This class aligns the image to the right side of its container.
- `object-top`: This class aligns the image to the top of its container.
- `object-bottom`: This class aligns the image to the bottom of its container.

These classes can be combined with other TailwindCSS classes to further style images, such as setting specific width or height, adding borders or shadows, or adjusting opacity.
