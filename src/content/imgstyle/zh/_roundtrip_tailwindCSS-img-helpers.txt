TailwindCSS provides several helper classes for the `<img>` tag. Here are some commonly used ones:

- `object-contain`: This class sets the image to fit the container while maintaining its aspect ratio. It will shrink or expand the image as needed to fit the container.
- `object-cover`: This class sets the image to cover the entire container while maintaining its aspect ratio. It will crop or shrink the image as needed to cover the container.
- `object-fill`: This class sets the image to fill the entire container without maintaining its aspect ratio. This may stretch or compress the image to fit the container.
- `object-none`: This class sets the image to its natural size without any resizing or cropping.
- `object-center`: This class centers the image horizontally and vertically within its container.
- `object-left`: This class aligns the image to the left within its container.
- `object-right`: This class aligns the image to the right within its container.
- `object-top`: This class aligns the image to the top within its container.
- `object-bottom`: This class aligns the image to the bottom within its container.

These classes can be combined with other TailwindCSS classes to further style your images, such as setting specific widths or heights, adding borders or shadows, adjusting opacity, etc.
