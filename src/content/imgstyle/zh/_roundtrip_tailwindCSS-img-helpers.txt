Tailwind CSS provides several helper classes for the `<img>` tag. Here are some commonly used classes:
- `object-contain`: This class sets the image to fit the container while maintaining its aspect ratio. It will scale down or up the image as needed to fit the container.
- `object-cover`: This class sets the image to cover the entire container while maintaining its aspect ratio. It will crop or scale down the image as needed to cover the container.
- `object-fill`: This class sets the image to fill the entire container without maintaining its aspect ratio. This can cause the image to be stretched or compressed to fit the container.
- `object-none`: This class sets the image to its natural size without any resizing or cropping.
- `object-center`: This class vertically and horizontally centers the image within its container.
- `object-left`: This class aligns the image to the left within its container.
- `object-right`: This class aligns the image to the right within its container.
- `object-top`: This class aligns the image to the top within its container.
- `object-bottom`: This class aligns the image to the bottom within its container.

These classes can be combined with other Tailwind CSS classes to further style your images, such as setting a specific width or height, adding borders or shadows, adjusting opacity, and more.
