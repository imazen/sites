Here are the general steps for creating an image gallery on a website:

1. Create a new HTML file for your image gallery. You can name it something like "gallery.html".
2. Add the HTML structure to your file. This typically includes the head section with a title and any necessary CSS style sheet, and the body section where you will add the actual gallery.
3. Create a container for your gallery using a `<div>` tag. Give it an ID or class so you can style it later.
4. Within the container, add individual image elements using the `<img>` tag. You can set the source attribute as the image file path or URL, and add any alternate text or captions as necessary.
5. Style your gallery with CSS. You can use properties like display, width, height, margin, padding, and border to control the layout and appearance of your gallery.

Here is an example code to create a simple image gallery:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
	<title>My Image Gallery</title>
	<style>
		.gallery {
			display: flex;
			flex-wrap: wrap;
			justify-content: center;
		}
		.gallery img {
			width: 300px;
			height: 200px;
			margin: 10px;
			object-fit: cover;
			border: 2px solid black;
		}
	</style>
</head>
<body>
	<div class="gallery">
		<img src="image1.jpg" alt="Image 1">
		<img src="image2.jpg" alt="Image 2">
		<img src="image3.jpg" alt="Image 3">
		<img src="image4.jpg" alt="Image 4">
		<img src="image5.jpg" alt="Image 5">
		<img src="image6.jpg" alt="Image 6">
	</div>
</body>
</html>
```

In this example, the gallery container has a class of "gallery" and is styled using flexbox to organize the images into a grid. Each image has a width of 300px, a height of 200px, a margin of 10px, and a solid 2px border in black color. The object-fit property is used to ensure that the images maintain their aspect ratio even if they are not the same size.

You can customize this code to fit your needs and design preferences.
