TailwindCSS provides several helper classes for working with the `<img>` tag. Here are some of the most commonly used ones:
- `object-contain`: This class adjusts the image to fit within its container while maintaining its aspect ratio. It will shrink or enlarge as necessary to ensure it fits within the container.
- `object-cover`: This class adjusts the image to cover the entire container while maintaining its aspect ratio. It will crop or reduce the image as necessary to ensure it covers the container.
- `object-fill`: This class adjusts the image to fill the entire container, without maintaining its aspect ratio. This can make the image stretch or compress to fit within the container.
- `object-none`: This class keeps the image to its natural size, without resizing or cropping.
- `object-center`: This class centers the image horizontally and vertically within its container.
- `object-left`: This class aligns the image to the left within its container.
- `object-right`: This class aligns the image to the right within its container.
- `object-top`: This class aligns the image at the top of its container.
- `object-bottom`: This class aligns the image at the bottom of its container.

These classes can be used in conjunction with other TailwindCSS classes to add additional styling to your images, such as setting a specific width or height, adding borders or shadows, or adjusting opacity.
