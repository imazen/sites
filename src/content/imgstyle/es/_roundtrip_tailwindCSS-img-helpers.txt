TailwindCSS provides several helper classes for working with the `<img>` tag. Here are some of the most commonly used ones:

- `object-contain`: This class adjusts the image within its container while maintaining its aspect ratio. It will resize or enlarge the image as necessary to ensure it fits within the container.
- `object-cover`: This class adjusts the image to cover the entire container while maintaining its aspect ratio. It will crop or resize the image as necessary to cover the container.
- `object-fill`: This class adjusts the image to fill the entire container, without maintaining its aspect ratio. This may cause the image to stretch or compress to fit within the container.
- `object-none`: This class adjusts the image to its natural size without any scaling or cropping.
- `object-center`: This class horizontally and vertically centers the image within its container.
- `object-left`: This class aligns the image to the left within its container.
- `object-right`: This class aligns the image to the right within its container.
- `object-top`: This class aligns the image to the top of its container.
- `object-bottom`: This class aligns the image to the bottom of its container.

These classes can be used in combination with other TailwindCSS classes to style your images, such as setting a specific width or height, adding borders or shadows, or adjusting opacity.
