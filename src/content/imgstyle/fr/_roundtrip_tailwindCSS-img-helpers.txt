TailwindCSS provides several utility classes for working with the `<img>` tag. Here are some of the most commonly used:

- `object-contain`: This class adjusts the image to fit its container while maintaining its aspect ratio. It will shrink or enlarge the image as needed to ensure it fits within the container.
- `object-cover`: This class adjusts the image to cover the entire container while maintaining its aspect ratio. It will crop the image or shrink it if necessary to ensure it covers the container.
- `object-fill`: This class adjusts the image to fill the entire container, without maintaining its aspect ratio. This may result in stretching or compressing the image to fit within the container.
- `object-none`: This class sets the image to its natural size, without resizing or cropping.
- `object-center`: This class centers the image horizontally and vertically within its container.
- `object-left`: This class aligns the image to the left within its container.
- `object-right`: This class aligns the image to the right within its container.
- `object-top`: This class aligns the image to the top of its container.
- `object-bottom`: This class aligns the image to the bottom of its container.

These classes can be used in conjunction with other TailwindCSS classes for even more style to your images, such as setting a specific width or height, adding borders or shadows, or adjusting opacity.
