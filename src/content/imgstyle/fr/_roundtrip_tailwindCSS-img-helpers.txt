TailwindCSS provides several helper classes for working with the `<img>` tag. Here are some of the most commonly used ones:
- `object-contain`: This class sets the image to fit inside its container while maintaining its aspect ratio. It will shrink or expand the image as required to fit inside the container.
- `object-cover`: This class sets the image to cover the entire container while maintaining its aspect ratio. It will crop or shrink the image as required to cover the container.
- `object-fill`: This class sets the image to fill the entire container, without maintaining its aspect ratio. This may result in the image being stretched or compressed to fit the container.
- `object-none`: This class sets the image to its natural size, with no resizing or cropping.
- `object-center`: This class centers the image horizontally and vertically within its container.
- `object-left`: This class aligns the image to the left within its container.
- `object-right`: This class aligns the image to the right within its container.
- `object-top`: This class aligns the image to the top of its container.
- `object-bottom`: This class aligns the image to the bottom of its container.

These classes can be used in conjunction with other TailwindCSS classes to further style your images, such as setting a specific width or height, adding borders or shadows, or adjusting opacity.
