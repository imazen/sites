TailwindCSS provides several helper classes for working with the `<img>` tag. Here are the most commonly used ones:
- `object-contain`: This class sets the image to fit the container while maintaining its aspect ratio. It will reduce or enlarge the image as necessary to fit the container.
- `object-cover`: This class sets the image to cover the entire container while maintaining its aspect ratio. It will crop or resize the image as necessary to fully cover the container.
- `object-fill`: This class sets the image to fill the entire container, disregarding its aspect ratio. This may cause the image to stretch or compress to fit the container.
- `object-none`: This class sets the image to its natural size, without any resizing or cropping.
- `object-center`: This class centers the image both horizontally and vertically within its container.
- `object-left`: This class aligns the image to the left within its container.
- `object-right`: This class aligns the image to the right within its container.
- `object-top`: This class aligns the image to the top of its container.
- `object-bottom`: This class aligns the image to the bottom of its container.

These classes can be used in conjunction with other TailwindCSS classes to further customize images, such as setting a specific width or height, adding borders or shadows, or adjusting opacity.
