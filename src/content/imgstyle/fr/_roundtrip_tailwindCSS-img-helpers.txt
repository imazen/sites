TailwindCSS provides several helper classes for working with the `<img>` tag. Here are the most commonly used ones:
- `object-contain`: this class sets the image to fit inside the container while preserving its aspect ratio. It will scale down or up the image as needed to fit inside the container.
- `object-cover`: this class sets the image to cover the entire container while preserving its aspect ratio. It will crop or scale down the image as needed to fully cover the container.
- `object-fill`: this class sets the image to fill the entire container, disregarding its aspect ratio. This may cause the image to stretch or compress to fit inside the container.
- `object-none`: this class sets the image to its natural size, without any resizing or cropping.
- `object-center`: this class centers the image both horizontally and vertically inside its container.
- `object-left`: this class aligns the image to the left inside its container.
- `object-right`: this class aligns the image to the right inside its container.
- `object-top`: this class aligns the image to the top of its container.
- `object-bottom`: this class aligns the image to the bottom of its container.

These classes can be used in conjunction with other TailwindCSS classes to further customize the images, such as setting a specific width or height, adding borders or shadows, or adjusting opacity.
