Some frequently asked questions regarding formatting and layout of images with CSS are:

**1. How do you define the size of an image in CSS?**

To define the size of an image in CSS, you can use the `width` and `height` properties. For example, to set the width of an image to 300 pixels, you can use the following CSS code:

```css
img {
  width: 300px;
}
```

**2. How do you center an image both horizontally and vertically with CSS?**

To center an image both horizontally and vertically with CSS, you can use the `display: flex` property and `justify-content: center` and `align-items: center` properties on a container that holds the image. For example, to center an image within a `div` element, you can use the following CSS code:

```css
div {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
}

div img {
  /* Optional: set a maximum width for the image */
  max-width: 100%;
}
```

**3. How do you make an image responsive with CSS?**

To make an image responsive with CSS, you can use the `max-width: 100%` property on the image. This will ensure that the image never exceeds the width of its container. For example:

```css
img {
  max-width: 100%;
  height: auto;
}
```

**4. How do you add a border or shadow to an image with CSS?**

To add a border or shadow to an image with CSS, you can use the `border` and `box-shadow` properties, respectively. For example:

```css
img {
  border: 1px solid black;
  box-shadow: 2px 2px 5px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);
}
```

**5. How do you align images side by side with CSS?**

To align images side by side with CSS, you can use the `display: inline-block` property on the images. For example:

```css
img {
  display: inline-block;
  /* Optional: set a margin between the images */
  margin-right: 10px;
}
```

**6. How do you set a background image with CSS?**

To set a background image with CSS, you can use the `background-image` property. For example:

```css
div {
  background-image: url('image.jpg');
}
```

**7. How do you crop an image with CSS?**

To crop an image with CSS, you can use the `clip` property. For example:

```css
img {
  clip: rect(0px, 100px, 100px, 0px);
}
```

This will crop the image to a square of 100x100 pixels starting from the top left corner.

**8. How do you add a hover effect to an image with CSS?**

To add a hover effect to an image with CSS, you can use the `:hover` pseudo-class. For example:

```css
img {
  /* Set the initial state of the image */
  opacity: 0.8;
}

img:hover {
  /* Set the state of the image when hovered over */
  opacity: 1;
}
```

**9. How do you control the spacing between images with CSS?**

To control the spacing between images with CSS, you can use the `margin` property. For example:

```css
img {
  margin-right: 10px;
}
```

This will add a 10 pixel margin to the right of each image.

**10. How do you create an image slideshow with CSS?**

To create an image slideshow with CSS, you can use the `@keyframes` rule to define the animation and the `animation` property to apply it to the images. For example:

```css
@keyframes slideshow {
  0% { opacity: 0; }
  100% { opacity: 1; }
}

img {
  /* Set the initial state of the images */
  opacity: 0;
  /* Set the duration and timing function of the animation */
  animation: slideshow 2s ease-in-out 0s infinite alternate;
}
```
