To add CSS effects and borders to an image, you can follow these steps:  
1. Select the image element in your HTML code. You can do this by using an ID or class selector or by directly selecting the `<img>` element.  
2. Define a CSS class or ID selector that applies the desired styles to the image. For example, you can use the following code to create a simple border around the image:

```css
.my-image {
  border: 2px solid black; /* Add a border */
}
```

3. Apply the CSS class or ID selector to the image element. For example, if you used the `.my-image` selector in step 2, you can add the following code to your HTML to apply the styles to the image:

```html
<img src="path/to/image.jpg" class="my-image">
```

4. Customize the styles as desired. In addition to borders, you can apply a range of CSS effects to images, such as filters, opacity, transitions, and animations. Here are some examples of CSS code that can be used to add effects to images:

```css
/* Add a shadow effect */
.my-image {
  box-shadow: 0 0 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5); /* Add shadow */
}

/* Add a grayscale filter effect */
.my-image {
  filter: grayscale(100%); /* Add grayscale */
}

/* Add a zoom transition effect on hover */
.my-image {
  transition: transform 0.3s ease; /* Add transition */
}
.my-image:hover {
  transform: scale(1.1); /* Add zoom on hover */
}
```

These are just a few examples of the many CSS effects and borders you can use to enhance your images. Experiment with different styles to find the ones that work best for your design.
