Here's how you can use CSS and aspect ratio to center and crop an image:
1. First, wrap your image in a container element such as a `<div>` or `<figure>`. This allows you to apply styles to the container that affect the image inside.
2. Set the container's `position` property to `relative`. This allows you to position the image inside the container.
3. Add a `::after` pseudo-element to the container. This is used to maintain the image's aspect ratio and create the cropping.
4. Set the `content` property of the `::after` pseudo-element to an empty string. This is necessary to create the element.
5. Set the `padding-bottom` property of the `::after` pseudo-element to a percentage value that corresponds to the image's aspect ratio. For example, if your image has a 4:3 aspect ratio, you would set the padding to `75%` (because 3/4=0.75). This creates the cropping below the image.
6. Set the `position` property of the `::after` pseudo-element to `absolute`. This positions the element within the container.
7. Set the `top`, `left`, `bottom`, and `right` properties of the `::after` pseudo-element to `0`. This will cause the element to fill the container and create the cropping.
8. Finally, set the position property of the image itself to `absolute`. This allows you to center the image within the container using the `top`, `left`, `bottom`, and `right` properties.

Here's an example CSS code you would use to center and crop an image with a 4:3 aspect ratio:

```css
.container {
  position: relative;
  width: 100%;
}

.container::after {
  content: "";
  display: block;
  padding-bottom: 75%; /* 4:3 aspect ratio */
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
  bottom: 0;
  right: 0;
}

img {
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
  bottom: 0;
  right: 0;
  margin: auto;
  max-width: 100%;
  max-height: 100%;
}
```

In this example, the `.container` element is the container for the image. The `::after` pseudo-element is used to create the cropping and maintain the image's aspect ratio. The `img` element is set to `position: absolute` so that it can be centered within the container using the `top`, `left`, `bottom`, and `right` properties.

By setting the `max-width` and `max-height` properties of the image to `100%`, the image will scale to fit the available space while maintaining its aspect ratio. This means that the cropping created by the `::after` pseudo-element will always be proportional to the size of the image.
