Modern CSS provides developers with efficient, concise tools for robust image management:

- **Aspect Ratio:**  
  The `aspect-ratio` property maintains fixed proportions, stabilizing layouts by preventing unexpected changes while images load.  
  ```css  
  .container {  
    aspect-ratio: 16/9;  
  }  
  ```

- **Object Fit & Object Position:**  
  Use `object-fit` (e.g., `cover`, `contain`) and `object-position` to precisely control image scaling and alignment within their containers, eliminating unwanted cropping or distortion.  
  ```css  
  img {  
    object-fit: cover;  
    object-position: center;  
  }  
  ```

- **Image-Set for Resolution Switching:**  
  The `image-set()` function offers resolution switching for background images, ensuring optimal clarity on high-resolution devices.  
  ```css  
  .hero {  
    background-image: image-set(url("hero.png") 1x, url("hero@2x.png") 2x);  
  }  
  ```

- **Additional Enhancements:**  
  `image-rendering` adjusts scaling algorithms for clear output (ideal for pixel art), while `filter` enables dynamic visual effects directly in CSS.

These features significantly simplify image presentation, reduce reliance on JavaScript hacks and complex solutions, thus facilitating everyday development tasks.
