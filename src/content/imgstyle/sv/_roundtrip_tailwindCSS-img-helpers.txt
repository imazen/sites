TailwindCSS provides several utility classes for working with the `<img>` tag. Here are some of the most commonly used ones:

- `object-contain`: This class sets the image to fit in its container while maintaining its aspect ratio. It will either shrink or expand the image as needed to make sure it fits in the container.
- `object-cover`: This class sets the image to cover the entire container while maintaining its aspect ratio. It will either crop the image or shrink it as needed to make sure it covers the container.
- `object-fill`: This class sets the image to fill the entire container without maintaining its aspect ratio. This may cause the image to stretch or compress to fit in the container.
- `object-none`: This class sets the image to its natural size without any resizing or cropping.
- `object-center`: This class centers the image both horizontally and vertically in its container.
- `object-left`: This class aligns the image to the left of its container.
- `object-right`: This class aligns the image to the right of its container.
- `object-top`: This class aligns the image to the top of its container.
- `object-bottom`: This class aligns the image to the bottom of its container.

You can use these classes in combination with other TailwindCSS classes to further style your images, such as setting a specific width or height, adding borders or shadows, or adjusting opacity. 

{{Note that the term used here is not the technical term for a CSS class, but rather a utility class or a helper class. The difference is that technically, classes in CSS are for defining reusable styles that can be used on multiple elements, whereas utility classes are for applying a specific style to a single element quickly and easily. However, the term "utility class" has become increasingly popular and widely used in the CSS community to describe this type of class.}}
