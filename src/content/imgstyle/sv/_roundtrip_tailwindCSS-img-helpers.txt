TailwindCSS provides several helper classes for working with the `<img>` tag. Here are some of the most commonly used:

- `object-contain`: This class makes the image fit within its container while preserving its aspect ratio. The image will shrink or enlarge as needed to fit within the container.
- `object-cover`: This class makes the image cover the entire container while preserving its aspect ratio. It will either crop the image or shrink it as necessary to ensure it covers the container.
- `object-fill`: This class makes the image fill the entire container, without preserving its aspect ratio. This may cause the image to stretch or compress to fit within the container.
- `object-none`: This class sets the image to its natural size, with no resizing or cropping.
- `object-center`: This class centers the image horizontally and vertically within its container.
- `object-left`: This class aligns the image to the left within its container.
- `object-right`: This class aligns the image to the right within its container.
- `object-top`: This class aligns the image to the top of its container.
- `object-bottom`: This class aligns the image to the bottom of its container.

These classes can be used in conjunction with other TailwindCSS classes to further style your images, such as setting a specific width or height, adding borders or shadows, or adjusting opacity.
