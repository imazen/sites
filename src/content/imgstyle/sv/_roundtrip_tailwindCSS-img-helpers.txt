TailwindCSS provides several helper classes for working with the `<img>` tag. Here are some of the most commonly used ones:
- `object-contain`: This class sets the image to fit within its container while maintaining its aspect ratio. It will either shrink or expand the image as needed to make it fit within the container.
- `object-cover`: This class sets the image to cover the entire container while maintaining its aspect ratio. It will either crop or shrink the image as needed to make it cover the container.
- `object-fill`: This class sets the image to fill the entire container without maintaining its aspect ratio. This can cause the image to stretch or compress to fit within the container.
- `object-none`: This class sets the image to its natural size without any resizing or cropping.
- `object-center`: This class centers the image horizontally and vertically within its container.
- `object-left`: This class aligns the image to the left within its container.
- `object-right`: This class aligns the image to the right within its container.
- `object-top`: This class aligns the image to the top of its container.
- `object-bottom`: This class aligns the image to the bottom of its container.

These classes can be used in conjunction with other TailwindCSS classes to further style your images, such as setting a specific width or height, adding borders or shadows, or adjusting opacity. 

{{Note that the term "container" is used consistently throughout the translation, but in Swedish it was "behållare", which could have also been translated as "wrapper". Both terms are used in the context of CSS, but "container" is more commonly used in the TailwindCSS documentation.}}
