The general steps for creating an image gallery on a website are as follows:

1. Create a new HTML file for the image gallery. You can name it something like "gallery.html".
2. Add HTML structure to the file. This typically includes a head section with a title and any necessary CSS stylesheets, as well as a body section to add the actual gallery.
3. Use a `<div>` tag to create a container for the gallery. Give the container an ID or class so that you can style it later.
4. Inside the container, add individual image elements using `<img>` tags. Set the source attribute to the path or URL of the image file, and add alt text or captions as necessary.
5. Adjust the gallery's style using CSS. You can control the layout and appearance of the gallery using properties such as display, width, height, margin, padding, and border.

Here is an example code for creating a simple image gallery:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
	<title>My Image Gallery</title>
	<style>
		.gallery {
			display: flex;
			flex-wrap: wrap;
			justify-content: center;
		}
		.gallery img {
			width: 300px;
			height: 200px;
			margin: 10px;
			object-fit: cover;
			border: 2px solid black;
		}
	</style>
</head>
<body>
	<div class="gallery">
		<img src="image1.jpg" alt="Image 1">
		<img src="image2.jpg" alt="Image 2">
		<img src="image3.jpg" alt="Image 3">
		<img src="image4.jpg" alt="Image 4">
		<img src="image5.jpg" alt="Image 5">
		<img src="image6.jpg" alt="Image 6">
	</div>
</body>
</html>
```

In this example, the gallery container has a class of "gallery" and is styled using flexbox so that the images can be arranged in a grid. Each image has a width of 300px, height of 200px, 10px of margin, a cover object fit property, and a 2px black filled border. The object-fit property ensures that the aspect ratio of the image is maintained even when the image sizes are different.

This code can be customized to fit your needs and preferences.
