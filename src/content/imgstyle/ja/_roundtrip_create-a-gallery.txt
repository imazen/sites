Here are the general steps to create an image gallery on a website:

1. Create a new HTML file for the image gallery. You can name it something like "gallery.html".
2. Add HTML structure to the file, including a head section that includes a title and any necessary CSS stylesheets, and a body section that includes the actual gallery.
3. Use a `<div>` tag to create a container for the gallery. Add an ID or class so that it can be styled later.
4. Inside the container, add individual image elements using `<img>` tags. Set the source attribute to the path or URL of the image file, and optionally add alt text or captions.
5. Adjust the gallery's style using CSS. Properties like display, width, height, margin, padding, and border can be used to control the layout and appearance of the gallery.

Here is an example code for creating a simple image gallery:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
	<title>My Image Gallery</title>
	<style>
		.gallery {
			display: flex;
			flex-wrap: wrap;
			justify-content: center;
		}
		.gallery img {
			width: 300px;
			height: 200px;
			margin: 10px;
			object-fit: cover;
			border: 2px solid black;
		}
	</style>
</head>
<body>
	<div class="gallery">
		<img src="image1.jpg" alt="Image 1">
		<img src="image2.jpg" alt="Image 2">
		<img src="image3.jpg" alt="Image 3">
		<img src="image4.jpg" alt="Image 4">
		<img src="image5.jpg" alt="Image 5">
		<img src="image6.jpg" alt="Image 6">
	</div>
</body>
</html>
```

In this example, the gallery container has a class of "gallery" and is styled to use flexbox to arrange the images in a grid. Each image has a width of 300px, a height of 200px, a margin of 10px, a border of 2px solid black, and an object-fit property that maintains the aspect ratio even if the image sizes are different.

This code can be customized as needed or desired.
