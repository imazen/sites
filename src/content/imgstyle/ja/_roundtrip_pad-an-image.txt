The following is a method for padding and centering images using CSS and aspect ratios:

1. First, you need to surround the image with a container element such as `<div>` or `<figure>`. This enables you to apply styles to the container and affect the inner image.
2. Set the container's `position` property to `relative`. This allows you to position the image inside the container.
3. Add a `::after` pseudo-element to the container. This is used to create padding while maintaining the aspect ratio of the image.
4. Set the `content` property of the `::after` pseudo-element to an empty string. This is necessary to create the element.
5. Set the `padding-bottom` property of the `::after` pseudo-element to a percentage value that corresponds to the aspect ratio of the image. For example, if the aspect ratio of the image is 4:3, set the padding to `75%` (since 3/4 = 0.75). This creates padding below the image.
6. Set the `position` property of the `::after` pseudo-element to `absolute`. This positions the element inside the container.
7. Set the `top`, `left`, `bottom`, and `right` properties of the `::after` pseudo-element to `0`. This makes the element fill the container and creates the padding.
8. Finally, set the `position` property of the image itself to `absolute`. This allows you to center the image inside the container using the `top`, `left`, `bottom`, and `right` properties.

Here is an example of the CSS code you would use to center an image with a 4:3 aspect ratio and add padding:

```css
.container {
  position: relative;
  width: 100%;
}

.container::after {
  content: "";
  display: block;
  padding-bottom: 75%; /* 4:3 aspect ratio */
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
  bottom: 0;
  right: 0;
}

img {
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
  bottom: 0;
  right: 0;
  margin: auto;
  max-width: 100%;
  max-height: 100%;
}
```

In this example, the `.container` element is the container for the image. The `::after` pseudo-element is used to create padding and maintain the aspect ratio of the image. The `img` element is positioned in the center of the container using the `top`, `left`, `bottom`, and `right` properties because it has been set to `position: absolute`.

By setting the `max-width` and `max-height` properties of the image to `100%`, the image will be scaled to fit the available space, and the padding created by the `::after` pseudo-element will be proportional to the size of the image.
