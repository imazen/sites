To add CSS effects or borders to an image, follow these steps:

1. Select the image element in the HTML code. Use an ID or class selector, or directly select the `<img>` element.

2. Create a CSS class or ID selector that defines the style you want to apply to the image. For example, to create a simple border around the image, you can use the following code:

```css
.my-image {
  border: 2px solid black;
}
```

3. Apply the CSS class or ID selector to the image element. For example, if you used the `.my-image` selector in step 2, you can add the following code to the HTML to apply the style to the image:

```html
<img src="path/to/image.jpg" class="my-image">
```

4. Customize the styles as needed. In addition to borders, you can apply various CSS effects to the image, such as filters, opacity, transitions, and animations. Here are examples of CSS code that can be used to add effects to an image:

```css
/* Add a drop shadow effect */
.my-image {
  box-shadow: 0 0 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);
}

/* Add a grayscale filter effect */
.my-image {
  filter: grayscale(100%);
}

/* Add a zoom transition effect on hover */
.my-image {
  transition: transform 0.3s ease;
}
.my-image:hover {
  transform: scale(1.1);
}
```

These are just a few examples of CSS effects and borders you can use to enhance an image. Experiment with different styles to find what works best for your design.
