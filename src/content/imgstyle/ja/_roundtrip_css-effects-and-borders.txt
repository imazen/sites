To add CSS effects and borders to images, you can use the following procedure:

1. Within your HTML code, select the image element either by using an ID or class selector, or by directly selecting the `<img>` element.

2. Define a CSS class or ID selector that applies the desired style to the image. For example, you can use the following code to create a simple border around the image:

```css
.my-image {
  border: 2px solid black;
}
```

3. Apply the CSS class or ID selector to the image element. For example, if you used the `.my-image` selector in step 2, you can add the following code to your HTML to apply the style to the image:

```html
<img src="path/to/image.jpg" class="my-image">
```

4. Customize the style as needed. In addition to borders, there are various CSS effects that you can apply to your images, such as filters, opacity, transitions, and animations. Here are some examples of CSS code you can use to add effects to your images:

```css
/* Add a drop shadow effect */
.my-image {
  box-shadow: 0 0 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);
}

/* Add a grayscale filter effect */
.my-image {
  filter: grayscale(100%);
}

/* Add a zoom transition effect on hover */
.my-image {
  transition: transform 0.3s ease;
}
.my-image:hover {
  transform: scale(1.1);
}
```

These are just some of the various CSS effects and borders you can use to enhance your images. Experiment with different styles to find the one that best suits your design.
