To add CSS effects and borders to images, you can use the following steps:

1. Select the image element in your HTML code. This can be done by using an ID or class selector, or by directly selecting the `<img>` element.
2. Define a CSS class or ID selector to apply the desired styles to the image. For instance, to create a simple border around the image, you can use the following code:

```css
.my-image {
  border: 2px solid black;
}
```

3. Apply the CSS class or ID selector to the image element. For example, if you used the `.my-image` selector in step 2, you can add the following code to your HTML to apply the style to the image:

```html
<img src="path/to/image.jpg" class="my-image">
```

4. Customize the styles to match your preferences. Besides borders, you can apply a wide range of CSS effects to the image such as filters, opacity, transitions, and animations. Here are some examples of CSS code you can use to add effects to an image:

```css
/* Add a drop shadow effect */
.my-image {
  box-shadow: 0 0 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);
}

/* Add a grayscale filter effect */
.my-image {
  filter: grayscale(100%);
}

/* Add a zoom transition effect on hover */
.my-image {
  transition: transform 0.3s ease;
}
.my-image:hover {
  transform: scale(1.1);
}
```

These are just a few of the many CSS effects and borders you can use to enhance your images. Experiment with different styles to find what works best for your design.
