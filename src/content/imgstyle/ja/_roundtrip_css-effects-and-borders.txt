To add CSS effects and borders to images, you can follow these steps:
1. Select the image element in your HTML code. This can be done by using an ID or class selector, or by selecting the `<img>` element directly.
2. Create a CSS class or ID selector that defines the styles to apply to the image. For example, you can use the following code to create a simple border around the image:

```css
.my-image {
  border: 2px solid black;
}
```

3. Apply the CSS class or ID selector to the image element. For instance, if you used the `.my-image` selector in step 2, you can add the following HTML code to apply the style to the image:

```html
<img src="path/to/image.jpg" class="my-image">
```

4. Customize the styles as needed. In addition to borders, you can apply a wide range of CSS effects to images, including filters, opacity, transitions, and animations. Here are some examples of CSS code that can be used to add effects to your images:

```css
/* Add drop shadow effect */
.my-image {
  box-shadow: 0 0 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);
}

/* Add grayscale filter effect */
.my-image {
  filter: grayscale(100%);
}

/* Add zoom transition effect on hover */
.my-image {
  transition: transform 0.3s ease;
}
.my-image:hover {
  transform: scale(1.1);
}
```

These are just a few examples of the many CSS effects and borders that can be used to enhance images. Try out different styles to find the best fit for your design.
