To add CSS effects or borders to an image, the following steps can be used:

1. Within your HTML code, select the image element, either by using an ID or class selector, or by selecting the `<img>` element directly.

2. Define the CSS class or ID selector that applies the desired style to the image. For example, the following code can be used to create a simple border:
```css
.my-image {
  border: 2px solid black;
}
```

3. Apply the CSS class or ID selector to the image element. For example, if you used the `.my-image` selector in step 2, you can apply the style to your image by adding the following code to your HTML:
```html
<img src="path/to/image.jpg" class="my-image">
```

4. Customize the style as needed. In addition to borders, various CSS effects can be applied to images, such as filters, opacity, transitions, animations, and more. Here are some examples of CSS code you can use to add effects to images:

```css
/* Add a drop shadow effect */
.my-image {
  box-shadow: 0 0 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);
}

/* Add a grayscale filter effect */
.my-image {
  filter: grayscale(100%);
}

/* Add a zoom transition effect on hover*/
.my-image {
  transition: transform 0.3s ease;
}
.my-image:hover {
  transform: scale(1.1);
}
```

These are just a few examples of the many CSS effects and borders that can be used to enhance images. Experiment with different styles to find the one that works best for your design.
