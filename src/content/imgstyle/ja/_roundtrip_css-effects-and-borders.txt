To add CSS effects and borders to images, follow these steps:

1. Within your HTML code, select the image element. This can be done by using an ID or class selector or by directly selecting the `<img>` element.

2. Define the CSS class or ID selector that will apply the desired styles to the image. For example, you can use the following code to create a simple border around the image:

```css
.my-image {
  border: 2px solid black;
}
```

3. Apply the CSS class or ID selector to the image element. For example, if you used the `.my-image` selector in Step 2, you can apply the style to an image in your HTML by adding the following code:

```html
<img src="path/to/image.jpg" class="my-image">
```

4. Customize the style as needed. In addition to borders, a variety of CSS effects can be applied to images, including filters, opacity, transitions, and animations. Here are some examples of CSS code that you can use to add effects to your image:

```css
/* Add a drop shadow effect */
.my-image {
  box-shadow: 0 0 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);
}

/* Add a grayscale filter effect */
.my-image {
  filter: grayscale(100%);
}

/* Add a zoom transition effect on hover */
.my-image {
  transition: transform 0.3s ease;
}
.my-image:hover {
  transform: scale(1.1);
}
```

These are just a few examples of the many CSS effects and borders that you can use to enhance your images. Experiment with different styles to find the ones that work best for your design.
