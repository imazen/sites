TailwindCSS provides several helper classes for manipulating the `<img>` tag. Here, we introduce the most commonly used ones:
- `object-contain`: This class configures the image to fit within the container while maintaining its aspect ratio. It adjusts the image by scaling down or up as necessary to fit the container.
- `object-cover`: This class sets the image to cover the entire container while maintaining its aspect ratio. It trims or scales down the image as necessary to cover the container.
- `object-fill`: This class configures the image to fill the entire container without maintaining the aspect ratio. This may result in the image being stretched or compressed to fit within the container.
- `object-none`: This class sets the image to its natural size without resizing or trimming.
- `object-center`: This class centers the image horizontally and vertically within the container.
- `object-left`: This class aligns the image to the left within the container.
- `object-right`: This class aligns the image to the right within the container.
- `object-top`: This class positions the image at the top of the container.
- `object-bottom`: This class positions the image at the bottom of the container.

These classes can be combined with other TailwindCSS classes to further style the image, such as setting specific widths and heights, adding borders and shadows, or adjusting opacity.
