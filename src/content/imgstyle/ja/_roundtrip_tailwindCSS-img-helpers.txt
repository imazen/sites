TailwindCSS provides several helper classes for manipulating `<img>` tags. The most commonly used ones are:

- `object-contain`: This class sets the image to fit within its container and maintain its aspect ratio. It scales the image down or up as necessary to fit inside the container.
- `object-cover`: This class sets the image to fully cover its container while maintaining its aspect ratio. It can crop or scale the image as necessary to cover the container.
- `object-fill`: This class stretches the image to fill its container without maintaining its aspect ratio. This may cause the image to become stretched or compressed to fit inside the container.
- `object-none`: This class sets the image to its original size without resizing or cropping.
- `object-center`: This class centers the image both vertically and horizontally within its container.
- `object-left`: This class aligns the image to the left within its container.
- `object-right`: This class aligns the image to the right within its container.
- `object-top`: This class aligns the image to the top of its container.
- `object-bottom`: This class aligns the image to the bottom of its container.

These classes can be combined with other TailwindCSS classes to further style images, such as by setting width and height, adding borders or shadows, or adjusting opacity.
