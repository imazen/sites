TailwindCSS provides several helper classes for working with `<img>` tags. Here are some of the most commonly used ones:

- `object-contain`: This class will maintain the aspect ratio of the image while keeping it within the container. The image will be scaled down or up as needed to fit inside the container.
- `object-cover`: This class will maintain the aspect ratio while causing the image to cover the entire container. The image may be cropped or scaled down as needed to cover the container.
- `object-fill`: This class will stretch or shrink the image to fit the entire container without maintaining its aspect ratio. This may cause the image to be stretched or compressed to fit inside the container.
- `object-none`: This class will set the image to its natural size without resizing or cropping it.
- `object-center`: This class will horizontally and vertically center the image within the container.
- `object-left`: This class will align the image to the left within the container.
- `object-right`: This class will align the image to the right within the container.
- `object-top`: This class will align the image to the top of the container.
- `object-bottom`: This class will align the image to the bottom of the container.

These classes can be used in combination with other TailwindCSS classes to further style images, such as setting their width and height, adding borders or shadows, and adjusting their opacity.
