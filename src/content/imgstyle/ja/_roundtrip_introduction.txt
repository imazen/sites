Modern CSS provides developers with powerful and effective tools for image processing:

- **Aspect Ratio:**  
  The `aspect-ratio` property enforces a fixed ratio, preventing unexpected layout shifts as images load and stabilizing the layout.  
  ```css  
  .container {  
    aspect-ratio: 16/9;  
  }  
  ```

- **Object-Fit & Object-Position:**  
  Using `object-fit` (e.g., `cover`, `contain`) and `object-position`, you can precisely control the scaling and positioning of images within a container, eliminating incorrect cropping or distortion.  
  ```css  
  img {  
    object-fit: cover;  
    object-position: center;  
  }  
  ```

- **Resolution Adaptability with Image Set:**  
  The `image-set()` function provides resolution switching for background images, ensuring optimal clarity on high DPI devices.  
  ```css  
  .hero {  
    background-image: image-set(url("hero.png") 1x, url("hero@2x.png") 2x);  
  }  
  ```

- **Additional Enhancement Features:**  
  `image-rendering` fine-tunes scaling algorithms to provide sharp output (ideal for pixel art), and `filter` enables dynamic visual effects within CSS.

These features significantly ease everyday development tasks by reducing reliance on JavaScript hacks or complex workarounds.
