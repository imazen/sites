Here are some frequently asked questions when styling and positioning images using CSS:

**1. How can I set the size of an image in CSS?**

To set the size of an image in CSS, you can use the `width` and `height` properties. For example, to set the width of an image to 300 pixels, use the following CSS code:

```css
img {
  width: 300px;
}
``` 

**2. How can I center an image both horizontally and vertically using CSS?**

To center an image both horizontally and vertically using CSS, use `display: flex` and the properties `justify-content: center` and `align-items: center` on the container holding the image. For example, use the following CSS code to center an image inside a `div` element:

```css
div {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
}

div img {
  /* Optional: Set the maximum width of the image */
  max-width: 100%;
}
``` 

**3. How can I make an image responsive using CSS?**

To make an image responsive using CSS, use the `max-width: 100%` property on the image. This ensures that the image does not exceed the width of its container. For example:

```css
img {
  max-width: 100%;
  height: auto;
}
``` 

**4. How can I add a border or shadow to an image using CSS?**

To add a border or shadow to an image using CSS, you can use the `border` and `box-shadow` properties. For example:

```css
img {
  border: 1px solid black;
  box-shadow: 2px 2px 5px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);
}
``` 

**5. How can I arrange images side by side using CSS?**

To arrange images side by side using CSS, use the `display: inline-block` property on the images. For example:

```css
img {
  display: inline-block;
  /* Optional: Set a margin between images */
  margin-right: 10px;
}
``` 

**6. How can I set a background image using CSS?**

To set a background image using CSS, use the `background-image` property. For example:

```css
div {
  background-image: url('image.jpg');
}
``` 

**7. How can I crop an image using CSS?**

To crop an image using CSS, you can use the `clip` property. For example:

```css
img {
  clip: rect(0px, 100px, 100px, 0px);
}
```

This clips the image to a 100x100 pixel rectangle starting from the top left corner.

**8. How can I add a hover effect to an image using CSS?**

To add a hover effect to an image using CSS, use the `:hover` pseudo-class. For example:

```css
img {
  /* Set the initial state of the image */
  opacity: 0.8;
}

img:hover {
  /* Set the state of the image when hovered */
  opacity: 1;
}
``` 

**9. How can I control the space between images using CSS?**

To control the space between images using CSS, use the `margin` property. For example:

```css
img {
  margin-right: 10px;
}
```

This adds a 10-pixel margin to the right of each image.

**10. How can I create an image slideshow using CSS?**

To create an image slideshow using CSS, define the animation using the `@keyframes` rule and apply the `animation` property to the images. For example:

```css
@keyframes slideshow {
  0% { opacity: 0; }
  100% { opacity: 1; }
}

img {
  /* Set the initial state of the images */
  opacity: 0;
  /* Set the duration and timing function of the animation */
  animation: slideshow
```
