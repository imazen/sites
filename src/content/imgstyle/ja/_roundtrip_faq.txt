The following are some common questions about styling and layout for images in CSS:

**1. How do I set the size of an image with CSS?**

You can use the `width` and `height` properties to set the size of an image with CSS. For example, to set the width of an image to 300 pixels, you can use the following CSS code:

```css
img {
  width: 300px;
}
```

**2. How do I horizontally and vertically center an image with CSS?**

You can use the `display: flex`, `justify-content: center`, and `align-items: center` properties on the container that holds the image to horizontally and vertically center the image with CSS. For example, to center an image in a `div` element, you can use the following CSS code:

```css
div {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
}

div img {
  /* Optional: Set the maximum width of the image */
  max-width: 100%;
}
``` 

**3. How do I make an image responsive with CSS?**

You can use the `max-width: 100%` property on the image to make it responsive with CSS. This ensures that the image does not exceed the width of its container. For example:

```css
img {
  max-width: 100%;
  height: auto;
}
```

**4. How do I add a border or shadow to an image with CSS?**

You can use the `border` and `box-shadow` properties to add a border or shadow to an image with CSS. For example:

```css
img {
  border: 1px solid black;
  box-shadow: 2px 2px 5px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);
}
```

**5. How do I horizontally align images with CSS?**

You can use the `display: inline-block` property on the image to horizontally align images with CSS. For example:

```css
img {
  display: inline-block;
  /* Optional: Set the margin between images */
  margin-right: 10px;
}
```

**6. How do I set a background image with CSS?**

You can use the `background-image` property to set a background image with CSS. For example:

```css
div {
  background-image: url('image.jpg');
}
```

**7. How do I crop an image with CSS?**

You can use the `clip` property to crop an image with CSS. For example:

```css
img {
  clip: rect(0px, 100px, 100px, 0px);
}
```

This clips the image to a 100x100 pixel square starting from the top-left corner.

**8. How do I add a hover effect to an image with CSS?**

You can use the `:hover` pseudo-class to add a hover effect to an image with CSS. For example:

```css
img {
  /* Set the initial state of the image */
  opacity: 0.8;
}

img:hover {
  /* Set the state of the image on hover */
  opacity: 1;
}
```

**9. How do I adjust the spacing between images with CSS?**

You can use the `margin` property to adjust the spacing between images with CSS. For example:

```css
img {
  margin-right: 10px;
}
```

This adds 10 pixels of margin to the right of each image.

**10. How do I create an image slideshow with CSS?**

You can use the `@keyframes` rule to define an animation and the `animation` property to apply the animation to the image with CSS. For example:

```css
@keyframes slideshow {
  0% { opacity: 0; }
  100% { opacity: 1; }
}

img {
  /* Set the initial state of the image */
  opacity: 0;
  /* Set the animation duration and timing function */
  animation: slideshow 1s ease-in-out infinite;
}
``` 

{{Note that the term "clip" used here refers to an older CSS property that has largely been replaced by the newer "clip-path" property.}}
