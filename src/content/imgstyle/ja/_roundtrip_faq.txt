Frequently asked questions related to styling and layout of images using CSS are as follows:

**1. How can I set the size of an image using CSS?**

You can use the `width` and `height` properties to set the size of an image using CSS. For example, the following CSS code can be used to set the width of an image to 300 pixels.

```css
img {
  width: 300px;
}
``` 

**2. How can I horizontally and vertically center an image using CSS?**

You can use the `display: flex`, `justify-content: center`, and `align-items: center` properties on the container holding the image to center it both horizontally and vertically using CSS. For example, the following CSS code can be used to center an image within a `div` element.

```css
div {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
}

div img {
  /* Optional: set a maximum width for the image */
  max-width: 100%;
}
``` 

**3. How can I make an image responsive using CSS?**

You can use the `max-width: 100%` property on an image to make it responsive using CSS. This ensures that the image never exceeds the width of its container. For example:

```css
img {
  max-width: 100%;
  height: auto;
}
``` 

**4. How can I apply border or shadow to an image using CSS?**

You can use the `border` and `box-shadow` properties respectively to apply a border or shadow to an image using CSS. For example:

```css
img {
  border: 1px solid black;
  box-shadow: 2px 2px 5px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);
}
``` 

**5. How can I horizontally align images using CSS?**

You can use `display: inline-block` property on each image to horizontally align images using CSS. For example:

```css
img {
  display: inline-block;
  /* Optional: set a margin between images */
  margin-right: 10px;
}
``` 

**6. How can I set a background image using CSS?**

You can use the `background-image` property to set a background image using CSS. For example:

```css
div {
  background-image: url('image.jpg');
}
``` 

**7. How can I crop an image using CSS?**

You can use the `clip` property to crop an image using CSS. For example:

```css
img {
  clip: rect(0px, 100px, 100px, 0px);
}
```

This clips the image to a 100 x 100 pixel square with the top-left corner as the starting point.

**8. How can I add a hover effect to an image using CSS?**

You can use the `:hover` pseudo-class to add a hover effect to an image using CSS. For example:

```css
img {
  /* Set the initial state of the image */
  opacity: 0.8;
}

img:hover {
  /* Set the state of the image when the mouse is over it */
  opacity: 1;
}
``` 

**9. How can I control spacing between images using CSS?**

You can use the `margin` property to control spacing between images using CSS. For example:

```css
img {
  margin-right: 10px;
}
```

This adds a 10-pixel margin to the right of each image.

**10. How can I create an image slideshow using CSS?**

You can use the `@keyframes` rule to define the animation and the `animation` property to apply it to the images using CSS. For example:

```css
@keyframes slideshow {
  0% { opacity: 0; }
  100% { opacity: 1; }
}

img {
  /* Set the initial state of the image */
  opacity: 0;
  /* Set the animation duration and timing function */
  animation: slideshow 2s ease-in-out;
}
``` 

{{Remember to add semicolon at the end of the value for animation property.}}
